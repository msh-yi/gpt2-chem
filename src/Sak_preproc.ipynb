       " '18 October 2019',\n",
       " 'Deracemization is an attractive strategy for asymmetric synthesis, but intrinsic energetic challenges have limited its development. Here, we report a deracemization method in which amine derivatives undergo spontaneous optical enrichment upon exposure to visible light in the presence of three distinct molecular catalysts. Initiated by an excited-state iridium chromophore, this reaction proceeds through a sequence of favorable electron, proton, and hydrogen-atom transfer steps that serve to break and reform a stereogenic C-H bond. The enantioselectivity in these reactions is jointly determined by two independent stereoselective steps that occur in sequence within the catalytic cycle, giving rise to a composite selectivity that is higher than that of either step individually. These reactions represent a distinct approach to creating out-of-equilibrium product distributions between substrate enantiomers using excited-state redox events. RESEARCH',\n",
       " ['We first observed deracemization behavior serendipitously while attempting to develop an asymmetric variant of a previously reported hydroamidation reaction mediated by an Ir-based photoredox catalyst, a dialkyl phosphate base, and an aryl thiol H-atom donor under visible light irradiation. We found that the use of chiral BINOL phosphates as Brnsted bases was effective in this chemistry and resulted in a modest amount of enantioselectivity. However, timecourse studies unexpectedly revealed that the urea product 1b was initially formed as a racemate but became slightly optically enriched during the course of the reaction. In subsequent control reactions, we subjected racemic 1b to the reaction conditions and observed significant optical enrichment with near-complete material recovery, indicating that a light-driven deracemization pathway was operative. Similarly, when enantiopure -1b was subjected to identical conditions using an achiral phosphate base, racemization of the stereogenic C-H bond was observed. ',\n",
       "  'To evaluate this hypothesis, we elected to further study the deracemization of N-arylsubstituted cyclic ureas. Preliminary studies demonstrated that a pendant amide H-bond donor group is crucial for obtaining high selectivities in the enantioselective deprotonation step using the chiral phosphate bases, prompting us to evaluate the deracemization of urea 2a as a model substrate. A small collection of BINOLderived phosphate bases were explored with ppy 2 PF 6 and an achiral thiophenol H-atom donor catalyst in tetrahydrofuran under irradiation with blue lightemitting diodes at room temperature. Although a BINOL-derived phosphate with 1-adamantyl groups gave essentially racemic product, an analogous catalyst bearing phenyl groups gave an improved er of 69:31. We hypothesized that there might be a stabilizing p-cation interaction between the oxidized substrate radical cation and the aryl substituents of chiral phosphate, prompting us to examine catalysts bearing more expansive aryl substituents. This in turn led to catalyst 3e, which gave 79:21 er and good yield. The addition of molecular sieves further improved the selectivity to 86:14 er. ',\n",
       "  'With these optimized deracemization conditions in hand, we found that a variety of structural changes in the urea substrate could be accommodated. Alkyl substituents of varying steric demand could be tolerated at the stereogenic carbon with uniformly good levels of enantioselectivity. Substitution of the distal urea nitrogen with the free N-H amide, benzyl, or isopropyl groups also provided the desired deracemized products with high levels of stereoselectivity. Structural changes on the acyclic amide moiety were also tolerated, as was a benzamide derivative. However, an N, N-dimethyl amide variant demonstrated a noticeable decrease in the er. Upon reaching the steady-state level of optical enrichment, all of the substrates studied here can be recovered in nearly quantitative yield. '])"
