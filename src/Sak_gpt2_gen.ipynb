      " stoivity, the incorporation or addition of any metal ions to the arylation products will likely result in enhanced rate and enantioselectivity. To achieve higher enantiocontrol, we explored the capacity of metal ions to influence the rates of aldination in addition to reducing the overall rate of product generation. Specifically, the addition of a metal ion to the aldehyde, as an iodine ion, or a pyrrole ion, provided reduced rates and enantiocontrol, while the corresponding iodine and pyrrole ions provided increased rates and enantioselectivity. In accord with earlier work, the rates and enantiocontrol of these coupling products are in accord with the kinetic resolution model.  We next examined the effect of various metal ions on product reactivity. A series of amines, including the a-arylation product, the d-arylation product, and the b-arylation product, led to lower rates and enantiocontrol compared to other metals ions. For example, using copper ions to enhance reactivity resulted in reduced rates of product formation, lower enantiocontrol and increased enantiocontrol. However, we were also able to achieve the highest enantiocontrol, with a k rel of 20 for both enantiomerates d-arylation products in the absence of the metal ion. In contrast, when aldehydes are exposed to the amines, they undergo accelerated reactivity that leads to decreased rates and enantiocontrol. For d-arylation products, k rel was also increased, albeit to a modest extent. For example, the amines 5 and 6 were used, the reaction rate in the presence of 5 was accelerated by 10 and 11, although still below the rate achieved in the presence of 6. Notably, the use of 6 afforded similar selectivity to the DMA-catalyst for the enantioselectivity. This is further corroborated by the lower enantiocontrol achieved. On the other hand, use of the amines 3 and 4 led to lower rate and enantiocontrol. This is the case for the amine 7, which reduces rates and enantiocontrol. Finally, the amines 3 and 4 were used as the catalyst for k rel and selectivity decreases that result from higher alkenzene substituations are observed in these compounds, which clearly indicate the importance of reducing the substituent.  We next examined the importance of controlling the substitution pattern of the carbomethyl group. In the absence of a nitrogen ion at the 3 a-position, the carbomethyl group appeared to be reduced, presumably, due to its reduced electrophility in the absence of nitrogen. Subsequent N-arylation resulted in a k rel of 11 for 6, compared to 12 obtained for 8 in an analogous system. The rate of product formation was also significantly lower in comparison to the dMA-catalyst. As predicted from the kinetic resolution model, a series of N-ortho substitutions at the 5 a position led to faster rate and enantioselectivity in comparison to the other substitutions for the 6 a-position. Moreover, substituting the carbomethyl group of DMA-catalyst 7 for the carbon carbon group in DMA-catalyst 3 was more deleterious to product induction without loss in enantioselectivity. In fact, we were able to obtain a k rel for 8 that is similar to the rates achieved in the analogous system in the presence of DMA-catalyst 3. It is important to note that the carbomethyl substitations were not accompanied by substantial alterations in enantiocontrol, which is consistent with the mechanistic hypothesis outlined in Scheme 1.  Our studies have highlighted the significance of using iodines as an enantioselective aldination tool to enhance eCdS reactivity in a general sense. While iodine-based catalysts were proposed to be superior in various contexts, we have also found that iodine catalysis has significant limitations with respect to the arylation product formation. It must be stressed that iodine and iodine-based catalysts are not superior substrate delivery mechanisms. For example, we have also found that iodines alone are inadequate catalysts for generating a range of arylated alcohol molecules. Moreover, iodine catalysis has no significant effect on the rate, enantioselectivity and product reactivity exhibited by the DMA-catalyst. Finally, our studies also demonstrate the extent to which iodine based catalysis is a general trend in the context of iodination reactions that could be accessed using the DMA-catalyst alone. Thus, we are able to conclude that iodine catalysis is a general element of ion mediated catalysts for enhancing reaction efficiencies in general. Further studies will be undertaken in the area to assess the practicality of this approach and more specifically to examine the effect of iodines and iodine salts\n",

      " 113 in the 3p oxidation state of the Ni species and thus higher reactivity, suggesting stronger cation interactions between the metal and carbon atoms of the Ni species. At the same time, we have been curious about the extent to which the Cs ions have interacted with the amine nucleoide -3. Since we have found a very high amount of NH oxidation of Ni in our experiment, we presume that the Cs ions are forming a highly oxidizing species. On the other hand, we have seen a very low amount of Cs ion deprotonation, at least according to the EC 3 experiment, which seems inconsistent with strong cation interactions between the Ni iodide and amine nucleiide.  Last, we reasoned that, under the same mechanism, a higher energy or lower energy amine species might be formed. This would explain why the Cs ions are not observed in these higher energy systems in the 3-p oxidation state.  It has been established that aqueous solvents and high temperatures lead to enhanced cation interaction between the metal and the oxygen atom of the amine nucleoide. This interaction can be inhibited, however, by low temperatures of solubility. Thus, even within the best solvent conditions, aqueous-solvents are not effective in dissociating cationic aluminum atoms from the amine nucleiide at low temperatures or at low solubility.  In terms of solubility of the Cs ions, a significant amount is produced when solubility is decreased, which indicates that low temperatures are not competitive with the Ni ions for the formation of the Cs ion. The opposite is true at low temperatures, when low solubility appears to inhibit thermal dissociation.  The high selectivity of the EC 3 experiment with anodized Ni is also intriguing. It is notable that anodized Ni is the most soluble electrophilic of all of the common electrophiles. This is consistent with prior evidence for the formation of many heteroatom Cs cation combinations, leading to low solubility. The fact that Cs cannot escape the pivalamide species, which possess the strongest Cs ion binding attachment, suggests that high levels of metalicity are needed to achieve high selectivity in this reaction.  As revealed in, these Ni nucleophiles do not degrade in solubility. When solubility is lowered to 1 M in toluene with 20 C, the Cs ions retain their value as an electrophile that can dissociate a significant amount in toluene. In the case of aqueous solvents, a slight decrease in solubility may be detected, such as a decrease in yield, but when exposed to cold toluanes, a significant loss in solubility is completely undetectable. As revealed in, Ni does not lose any selectivity in the reaction. Thus, the low solubility of Ni is not a serious source of the observed low selectivity.  Given the very high selectivity exhibited by aqueous solvents and that of cold toluene, anodized Ni should be the most electrophilic electrophilic of the electrophiles studied herein.  It should be noted that, in general, higher temperatures lead to diminished solubility. For example, a lower temperature is required to reach a similar selectivity in the case of chloroform, dioxane, nitroform, p-nitroform, chloroform. Toluene was the optimal temperature tested, with a temperature range ranging from 20 C to 40 C. It should be noted that a lower temperature was also tested for this reaction, and the EC 3 experiment is somewhat less selective. Based on the higher selectivity and the fact that aqueous solvents are poor solubility systems in this reaction, we suggest that high temperatures are not generally a competitive source of the cation ion separation. The fact that the low selectivity observed by cold toluene was not observed in chloroform, dioxane, nitroform, nitroform, p-nitroform, chloroformat, dioxane, nitroform, p-nitroform, chloroform is consistent with the fact that the cation is not formed when cold toluene is used as solvent. This finding is a significant consequence of the higher temperature environment in the reaction reaction.  To demonstrate aqueous solubility of 1 Cs ion, we performed the same reaction with anodized Ni as well. We found that a significant increase in selectivity was observed when solubility was decreased from 1 M to 0 M in toluene at 21 C. Thus, the high selectivity was not a combination of solubility and temperature with alkene or alkene as solubility medium. The fact that aqueous solvents are not competitive in this reaction indicates that the cation is readily bound to the amines via a Ni,\n",

      " as i, j, k clusters or as a single point. Thus, we chose not to make use the simple i, z-imaging techniques discussed previously for the Hs-HPLC.  As noted previously, we employed the 3. 0-BINOL-HCl catalyst 3-nitrobenzoic acid as a catalyst for the asymmetric BINOL-BINOL linkage reaction. This catalystsubstrate interaction mechanism was first demonstrated in the context of cyclohexanol and chlorohexose and has been extended and elaborated to include a wide range of chemical systems. Recent work on the acylation of aldehydes through benzyloxyproline catalyzed nitroglone imine formation has shown that peptide-based catalysts can catalyze the asymmetric nitrochiral nitro-pyridine nitro-pyridine nitro-Ns-Bn-Phe-OMe-BNp-Phe-POxy. In light of studies on nitro-chiral nitro-A -nitrobenzyl -nitrobenzoic acid-Ns -n-imines, we anticipated that this catalyst will be more readily employed for nitro-chiral nitro-nitro reactions. Thus, we evaluated several catalystsets of nitro-nitro reactions based on enantioselectivityand catalyst-substrate interactions, and found a catalyst that provides high enantioselectivity. We attribute this catalyst-substrate interaction-imine coupling mechanism to the selectivity afforded by the urea aspartic acid catalysts, with the enantioselectivity provided by the peptide 2, 3-dinitryldoic acid derivative 2.  Enantioselective nitro-nitro reactions of cyclohexythyl p-butylidene acetals proceed via catalyzed anilines: catalyzed BINOL-PYRNA-P-Phe-PNP sequence extension is the site of stereocontrol. By a structural comparison of catalyst 2. 1 -2. 3, we identified catalysts with different enantiomeric ratios that favor the desired nitro-nitro aromatic cyclizations in excellent yield. With enantiomer selectivity, the catalyst provides high levels of enantioselectivity. An excellent example of a peptide catalyst that provides high enantiomeric ratios in the nitro-nitro cyclizations is catalyst 2. 5 -2. 5, which provides the optimal enantiomeric ratio in the nitro-nitro cyclizations. Furthermore, the addition of a 3:1 ratio in the nitro-nitro cyclization further improves the enantiomeric ratio to 20:1.  The catalyst 2. 7 is slightly lower favoring the nitrocyclization reactions using its catalytic P-hydroxysulfonyl-P-D-PNP motif. In each case, enantiomeric ratios were slightly lower. These catalysts provide modest yields of cycloheptyl nitro reactions using this structure. However, the nitrocyclization reactions have been extensively studied, and these catalysts are effective for many cyclizations.  We recently asked whether or not catalysts based on 2, 3-dinitryldoic acid derivatives might function as a nitro-nucleophile catalyst in the nitro-nitro cycle. To the extent that nitro-nitro reactions from aldehydes based on catalysts, catalysts, or inhibitors might function for nucleophile activation and nitro-nitro cyclization. We have already identified peptide-based catalyzes that exhibit excellent levels of enantiomeric ratios for nitrocyclization reactions. These catalysts employ the simple 2, 5dinitryldoic acid. We further evaluated catalysts that provided high enantioselectivities in an enantiomeric ratio of 4, 5-dinitrophenol, 1. 5-dioxynhydroxylamine, and in nitrocyclization reactions. Peptide 2. 4, which is characterized by a D-Pro-Aib -D-Aib -D-Pro sequence extension, provided very high enantiomer ratios in the nitrocyclization reactions with a moderate 2. 4 enantiomer ratio of 2. 3, and was observed with substantial substrate substrate reactivity and er for the nitrocyclization reactions. In addition, the addition of catalysts containing 2, 3-dione as a N-terminal N, N-dimethylacetamidite and as a BINOL-PYRNA-P-Phe-PNP sequence extension provided nitrocyclization reactions with excellent enantiomeric ratios. For the nitrocyclizations, a reasonable catalyst-substrate interaction mechanism was observed. The reaction with 2. 5 -nitrobenzaldehyde proceeded with high catalyst loadings and substrate reactivities.\n",

      " First the reaction was heated to 80C in C18 cells overnight. In the morning, the cells were lysin-fixed with diethyl ether. The cells were resynthesized in diethyl ether overnight. The cells were centrifuged in diethyl ether at 80 8C for 2 h and then washed with diethyl ether and brine. The cells were collected and placed in fresh diethyl ether overnight. After the cells were lysin-fixed, the cells were plated in a 96well plate with diethyl ether. The cell pellet was placed in a separate vessel. After the cells were plated in a 96well plate, the cells were incubated with diethyl ether for 24 h. Each time the cells were incubated without diethyl ether for 1 h, the cells were treated with diethyl ether and then rinsed with water and brine. When a reaction was carried out in the presence of diethyl ether, the diethyl ether was removed and the reaction was stored in its own well of a solution. In a separate medium, diethyl ether was heated at 80C in a solution containing diethyl ether and diethyl ether. The mixture was then filtered to reduce the diethyl ether to diethyl ether. After the diethyl ether was purified in HPLC, the reaction was filtered through Celite. The resulting brownish colour was taken at pH 9C, filtered through Celite and finally concentrated in diethyl ether. The crude product was then allowed to cool to 0C and then to the concentration station without further purification.   This simple and highly functionalized reaction, which was demonstrated to allow the construction of complex and biologically active compounds in an environmentally benign manner, was first reported by Gellman and co-workers. A number of subsequent contributions from this group have been reported. One aspect that attracted the interest of the researchers over the initial report was the development of cross diastereoselective polyol reactions. For example, cross-polar cross-couplings with aldehydes.  A second aspect that attracted the interest of this report was the use of amino acids and peptides for reactivity. A small library of peptide-based catalysts were explored. Most of the peptides in the library contain the BOC-Ala sequence and a single amino acid side chain. The most notable result with respect to the use of amino acids for cross-coupling is that approximately 70 of the peptides were found to be effective, albeit with a moderate number of poorly performing peptides. When the reaction is performed with a peptide containing the Boc sequence only, the reaction was found that a number of the amino acids selected for reactions under the conditions discussed in Scheme 2, and the reaction yield, if any, was notably high.  To evaluate the efficacy of peptides 4 and 16. The efficacy of peptide 4 was investigated. The reaction of aldehydes with acetonitrile is well-known and has been known to yield high yields for years. One problem, however, is the large size of the aldehyde and the small number of amino acids that can be catalytically incorporated into large molecules. In these cases, catalyst design has provided opportunities for flexibility, especially with respect to the presence of non-natural, unnatural, or partially substituted amino acids. That is, to create synthetically useful polyol motifs for use in large and diverse structures, and in conjunction with other novel and known methods for asymmetric reactions. We felt that we had high potential to apply this synthetic technology in this context, especially with respect to the possibility of using an amino as a starting place for further catalyst development. A few examples of peptide-based cross-coupling reactions that have been achieved are presented below.  In these cases, we have described highly diastereoselective reactions that have been executed enantioselectively. In this paper, we report peptide-based solutions to this challenge. In the context of the present reaction, we have developed a peptide-based approach to the enantioselective synthesis of natural products. The method provides a general approach for the preparation of peptide-based catalysts by following a motif that has previously been successfully applied in the asymmetric production of biaryl compounds. We have previously demonstrated that natural products can be produced enantioselectively under the selective catalysis of short peptide sequences in the production of bioactive peptides. In this context, the selective derivatization of naturally occurring, de novo syntheses of amino ester residues with low energy side chain modifications is described. The selective, selective functionalization of carboxyanhydides with peptide-based catalysts in the manufacture of natural products is reviewed.  To highlight the utility of this synthetic strategy in the synthesis of large and diverse structures, an evaluation of the reaction scope demonstrated that a variety of readily accessible,\n",

      "called 5. The catalyst for the reaction is called 2. These results demonstrate that catalyst 2 is the most active catalyst for this reaction, which further indicates that the catalyst-controlled stereodifferentiation of ketones is the fundamental reaction that is responsible for catalysis of the reaction. These results further highlight the role that achiral catalyst-controlled stereodifferentiation can have on catalyst performance in complex settings. In this particular case, achiral catalyst 2 provides the catalyst for a highly stereoselective reaction that can be carried out by differentially substituted ketones. While catalysts that deliver different stereoisomers of ketones each reactivity is matched with a different enantiomer of ketone, each enantiomer is found to react more selectively than the other enantiomers. This result might provide a mechanistic insight into the enantiodivergent functional group selectivity that catalysts are able to achieve in environments with limited chiral support. Another way the present study might work is by monitoring the rate of reaction of different enantiomers of ketones. In a separate study, chiral catalyst 2 was found to be able to catalyze the reaction of racemic 2-phenyldimethylpiperidine and cyclohexanone 10 a ketone is the first amino acid to form a peptide. Therefore, catalysts are able to choose a position on a peptide, called a chirality, that will provide the catalytically active phenyl ester or amine. This allows catalyst 2 to match enantioenriched ketones of different enantiomers with different enantiomerically enriched, chiral amino acids. These processes are complex and have been accomplished many times. For example, one enantiomer of 4-methylphenyldimethylpiperidine undergoes catalyst-controlled, stereoselective oxidation of cycloheptanone to its corresponding cyclohexanone. A second enantiomer of the same catalyst is found in the reaction of cycloheptanone 13 to give cyclohexanone 14. This enantiomeric selectivity is thought to be a consequence of the chirality of the catalyst. However, the two enantiomers are observed as different enantiomers of the cycloheptanone, a phenomenon that is consistent with enantioenriched ketones reacting selectively to yield the desired cyclobutane derivatives.  This enantioselective catalyst-controlled enantioselective ketone oxidation provides a striking example of a reaction where catalyst controls both enantiomeric catalysis of the desired reaction product, and enantiomeric catalysis of the product. This is particularly true in light of the fact that ketones can be prepared from achiral precursors and used to selectively prepare the corresponding cyclic ketones, which appear enantiomeric at reaction temperatures. For example, enantiomeric catalysts that lead to cycloheptanones with low k 2 ar. ketones, such as catalysts that give higher k 2 enantiomeric selectivity for alkyl-substituted aldehydes, could present a challenging set of reactivities for catalyst 2 to control. As a followup study, this approach was applied to aldehydes that are enantiopure, an option that is increasingly common for the synthesis of enantiomers. When the catalyst and substrate are employed together, catalyst 2 presents a formidable challenge for substrate control. Thus, enantiomerically enriched, cyclohexenone-containing compounds present in the reaction conditions, may appear in the same reaction medium as catalyst 2. Under these conditions, substrate inhibition and regioselectivity are present, leading to substrates that are monophosphorylated or nearly so. These results represent a challenging case for catalyst 2 because it presents substrates that are potentially monophosphorylated and enantiopure, and its is thus presented as a second enzyme. This is clearly a scenario in which substrate and catalyst are matched appropriately.  In 1997, Ting and co-workers reported a series of enzymatic catalysis reactions that utilized the enzyme linolenovoic acid to catalyze asymmetric reactions such as b-couplings and diastereoselectivisection. In this investigation, substrate and oxidant were coupled to form a peptide by an ethoxy carbinyl radical using an a-bromoester linkage. Catalysts were employed to catalyze the bromo-mercaptobenzoic acid coupling reaction. Reaction conditions that favor activation of the bromoarene include o-bromides, quinazolinone diisostere, and\n",

      "yl. This effect is believed to be closely related to the observed decrease in the catalytic efficiency when using L-3-butane over a previously studied Csp 2 O 2 -O cation. The decreased reactivity seems to be closely related to the reduced mole fraction of the product relative to reactions using O-acyl and O-acryl as the respective replacement for L- 3-butane.   The observed decrease in yield when using acrylate-containing peptides has also been questioned. We were unable to obtain a single yield at temperatures greater than 0C for these reactions. We postulate that, due to the unfavorable HOMO charge transfer from the solvent maturation pocket via the primary amine, the reaction can't proceed at room temperature, which further limits the range of product that may be obtained. Furthermore, at greater concentrations, the formation of acrylate is likely to become more complicated.  The relative reactivity of Ac, Et and Au as a function of acrylate solvent maturation has been questioned. We present the results for Ac, Et and Au.  the data are available in supplementary information, supporting the conclusion that only the lowest-energy Au is engaged in a competitive association with the Ni catalyst. Additionally, the reactivity data for the Ac, Et and Au systems versus their Au counterparts are shown in.  The greater selectivity for Ac, Et and Au as a function of solvent maturation is most likely due to the higher HOMO energy of Au relative to the other two systems as their greater solvent accessibility will allow greater protonation of Au the higher intrinsic rate of Au will further increase the increase in the rate of the protonation, leading to increased overall rate, thus leading to greater selectivity for the overall process.\n",
      "The data also support the hypothesis that these higher selectivity levels are maintained through interactions between the tertiary amine and O-acyl, presumably to facilitate the reduction of Au.  An examination of the peptide sequence reveals that is not only compatible with the results of the original experiment, but likely the highest levels of selectivity for the first-order homologous series. While the lowest-energy Au, Ac and Au schemes did not outperform the higher-energy Ac, Et and Au schemes, the lowest-energy Ac, Et and Au schemes were significantly less selective, and even the most selective for the 1storder homologous series. Despite this, the Au scheme is likely the most selective for the series, because of the limited number of stereocenters on the single-turn system and the higher number of conformational states available to the 2, 7-trifluoromethylated amine compared to the 2, 4-trifluoromethylated amine, which is the most selective in the series.  The data support our proposed mechanism for the selectivity achieved with the optimized sequence. While no one scheme can ever be completely optimized due to the number of different bicyclic structures that may populate the same set of structural spaces, we do believe the optimized solution to the acrylate reduction is consistent with the high level of stereoselectivity achieved in this case. However, this does not change the fact that the number of acrylates that may be generated by reduction of a complex precursor, including bicyclic -amino acids, is considerably greater than the number of aryl rings, which contain similar structural elements. Thus, it is likely that the rate of the overall reaction, in terms of product isolation, diminishes as compared to the analogous reaction containing only a single unit.  The fact that the 3, 3-aarylation is likely to be slower than that of the 1, 1-arylation points to the need to achieve substantial substrate control over the reduction of 1 to afford a stable, robust -alkyl carbon, which is difficult to achieve via catalysis. For example, in the 3, 3-borylation, it is likely that the control of the -alkylation of 1 will be exerted in this case due to the inherent low -stereocontrol. A more intricate control over the reduction is due to the presence of the 3, 3-aryl group, which can be placed on the anilinic nitrogen of the amine in order to effectively shield the re-face of the amide, resulting in the reduction of 1 to an unselective -alkyl. The loss of 4 will reduce the rate of the -aryl reduction, in comparison to the other schemes. However, this effect reverses when the nitrogen of the amine is converted to amine -aldehyde, thus increasing the rate of the reaction.  The selectivity of the 3, 3-aryl reduction is thus affected by the steric demands of the amine unit. However, it is interesting that the rate of the reaction is decreased when the amine is replaced with the amine -aldehyde. If sterically demanding amines are substituted on the amine, then\n",

      " In NMR Spectra, Hnigs base is a very minor player in the picture, with only 2 ppm of Hnigs base. But on a larger scale, these compounds exhibit very different NMR spectra. Whereas the CD, IR, and Hnigs bases are all labeled to some extent in the literature, the PPh 3-labeled variety is often completely non-labeled. Moreover, unlike the CD, IR, and PPh 3 labels, the CX, CZ, and CY derived from the C8-CZ bond are missing a PH 3 group. These two sets of catalysts exhibit very different, non-identifying, or enhanced, IR resonances than the others. However, the degree to which the stereochemistry in these acylated peptides has varied across the catalyst series is also unknown. The structural features that confer functionality to the catalysts in each series are also different. This creates a curious discrepancy between the states that Hamilton and Weix have depicted in their work. Whereas Hamilton has presented structural attributes relevant to the uniformity of functionalization throughout the peptide-catalyzed acylation of cis-hexans, Weix has focused on the more dynamic and phenol substructures. In particular, C-terminal allylsilanes and isochrones have been the subject of extensive studies. The basis of the divergent behavior of the two enantiomers of catalyst 9 is also uncertain, although recent work suggests that similar transition states lead to equivalent structures in the bis-catalyzed BVO as they both follow the same general trend of b-turn secondary structure. Whereas all three catalysts follow the same general turn motif, Boc Pmh is conformationally different. Whereas the C-terminal residue of 9 is oriented such that it leads to two ortho-ortho interconverting states, the C-terminal edge of Pmh leads to a different, noncombining mode. For this reason, the two enantiomers of 9 differ in both secondary structures. Additionally, the two modes of hydrogen bonding between the tertiary amine NH and O are different. Whereas the Cxis is strong, the Cye is stronger, leading to two mixed modes. Lastly, the two modes of HS-Boc Pmh are different as well. Whereas the Cxis leads to mixed modes, the Cye leads to a single, undifferentiating mode.  In discussing each catalytically active conformer under the umbrella of type I and II conformers, we first discussed the advantages of the former conformer in terms of the catalysts ability to be used as a source of functional groups and the advantages of utilizing a chiral environment such as a peptide. We then discussed the disadvantages and advantages of the latter conformer, as these aspects were found to influence the activities and selectivity of the catalyst tests. While the former conformer is indeed quite LOU sensitive, the large standard deviation of the data set means that there are likely thousands of other structures that could be generated in the presence of simple peptide catalysts. Thus, the question remains as to whether a single, universal catalyst could produce sufficient enantioselectivities to be used for all cases. We currently conclude that, under the appropriate conditions, a single catalytic peptide could provide a reasonable approximation of sufficient enantioselectivities in the presence of relevant substrates.  With the development of a universal catalyst for the treatment of a given scaffold in hand, the next question is what substrate types would be compatible with the new catalysts, given the substantially different substrate microenvironment. The answer to this question appears to be: any substrate that contains a large number of similar functional-groups-indeed, any structure that contains a small number of conserved functional-groups-is likely to be amenable to catalyst interaction. As a result, there will likely be specific interactions exhibited by the catalyst that are specific to each structure. This is why the specific interactions below have been important. As a next step, we determined that it would be useful to identify a methodology for the rapid catalyst screening of structurally relevant scaffolds. Specifically, given the availability of enormous array of peptides that had been synthesized, we wished to assess short peptides that might produce comparable or improved selectivity in the treatment of the Boc-protected version of 3. Thus, we have established contact experiments as an important strategy for catalyst discovery. In the present case, we subjected 12-mer 12 to conditions that had been optimized for the Muc-protected analogue. We were pleased to find that catalysts 7 and 11 for the selected hydrofunctionalization step were relatively unencumbered. The catalyst for Muc-protected 3 is shown in, where the direction of rotation is indicated. In all other cases, the direction of the major and minor diastereomeric curves is indicated. Importantly, no diastereoselectivity was observed in the reaction of 3 with either,\n",

As shown in, these mild oxidative reactions cover a broad substrate scope including farnesol, 1-acetyldimethyl-2-phenyl-cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde, 5-cyanoindole, 6-pentanol, alkyl ethanol and a variety of acrylates. It is important to note that the presence of 1, 4-dicarboxaldehyde did not preclude any reaction with these farnesol and acrylate substrates at room temperature. In addition, a wide range of electronically and sterically distinct substrates 2428 were tolerated in this reaction.  Last, and perhaps most important, the reaction tolerated electron-donating nitrogen atoms on the trifluoroacetophenone ring. Notably, cyclic nucleophiles with a trifluoroacetophenone trifluorophenate motif can also be realized via this dual-catalysis strategy. 8b, d Recently, a strategy under attack from many lines of attack from various biological, chemical and pharmaceutical toxicologists has become the production of enantioenriched natural products and bioactive compounds. Enantioenriched natural products and bioactive compounds have the potential to alter drug discovery. As such, selective access to enantioenriched and selectively used natural products could have wide implications for biological agent discovery.  While a catalyst in the form of peptide 4 that bears a diazirine-binding motif can only be found in the CNS, its enantiopurity can be increased from 15 ee when the substrate is in the peripheral part of the CNS to 32 ee when the substrate is in the brain.  The enhanced enantioenriched content of 17 is not the only important factor that contributes to this dual catalysis strategy. The chirality in 2 also plays a significant role in the reaction, as it can either aid in the discrimination of the pyridine direction of the trifluoroacetophenone aldol or the olefin to be oriented toward 2 can allow for reactivity with 5 to give 4. 3 instead of 4. 2 and 32 ee in favor of 8.  While natural products are thought to be able to catalyze their own bifurcation, enantioselective reactions of up to 50:1 between 2 and 8 can also be realized\n",

The asymmetric asymmetric catalytic asymmetric BaeyerVilliger reaction of up to 87 ee between 2 and 11 also supports the hypothesis that the stereochemistry of 6 is important for this process.  The BaeyerVilliger reaction of up to 83 ee between 2 and 11 has been established to be an important entry in the development of anti-syn strategies and is a particularly intriguing example because of its similarity to the enantiodivergent BaeyerVilliger reaction in which peptide 4 reacts with one enantiomer of -4 to form 2. This reaction has also been exploited to develop the first enantioselective Barthold strategy in asymmetric BaeyerVilliger reactions. The chemical complexity of the related reactions, coupled with their high barriers to general solution strategies, have made the development of general strategies to access stereochemical control difficult. But, Lewis acids and Lewis bases are able to exert a small amount of stereocontrol in asymmetric BaeyerVilliger reactions more challenging.  One approach to asymmetric transition metal-catalyzed BaeyerVilliger reactions uses stoichiometric activation to induce stereocontrol in the production of diketopiperazines, which are simple alkyl-substituted compounds that are readily accessible to ligands. However, catalytic asymmetric BaeyerViger reactions tend to be much more complicated and are more severely limited by the kinetic impurities of the key reaction partners. Furthermore, due to the high substituents, the stoichiometric activation approaches have been much more limited. For example, in the most common approach, a simple ketone or a simple aldehyde be employed as a substrate, a biphasic mixture of monoener and silyl-substituted is readily achieved. As the reaction concentration increases, the enantiocontrol changes and the selectivity increases. However, catalyst loadings are typically less than 10 mol, making the process asymmetric. To further maximize the potential of this reaction, several novel catalyst classes have been proposed, including Lewis basesand Lewis acids.  The enantioselective implementation of alcohol within peptide-catalyzed asymmetric BaeyerVilliger reactions has long been established as an important strategy for the development of biologically active compounds. As early as 1977, Martin and We observed that peptides containing benzylic alcohol\n",

      ". 1. 1-Naphthyl-substituted tetramer P1. Phosphate isomer 5. 1. 3-Naphthyl-substituted d-Pro-X has been shown to be more effective than N-methylimidiazole in inhibiting PI3P phosphorylation of bovine ovarian steroids.  However, the effect of substituents near the 4-position of the inhibitor was less clear and perhaps more significant. Substituents on the 6-position reduce the binding energy of the substrate and thus the selectivity of the enzyme. In the context of drug discovery, an amino acid appended to a receptor that displays low protein affinity has been shown to act as an effective phosphorylating agent. Thus, peptides containing the C-terminal N-methyl imidazole showed reduced phosphorylation of the bovine steroid 9. 2. The exact role of the C-terminal position in the catalytic phosphorylation response is not currently understood. However, preliminary studies show that the C-terminal position does indeed confer significant activity in the inhibition of the PI3P phosphorylation of bovine steroid 9. 2.  A more detailed study of the role of the C-terminal position in the enantioselective phosphorylation reaction was accomplished with peptides 9. 3 and 9. 4, in which the C-terminal position is made as the trans subunit. In this arrangement, the phenyl ring is directed inward toward the chiral skeleton to form a more compact structure. Phenyl ring users with a trans-ris side chain on the bovine steroid scaffold exhibited no significant effect on the enantioselectivity measured against controls or against the peptide, while an appended amide greatly affected the enantiomeric excess of the corresponding enantiomer 19. 1. These data show that the absolute steric size of the side chain of the aromatic residue does not significantly affect the enantioselectivity of the enzyme in the phosphorylation of 9. 4. Furthermore, compounds possessing the C-terminal amide were examined as substrates for the PI3P enzyme. As shown in the, compounds in which the benzyl group of the amide, rather than a methyl group, is oriented in the plane defined by the -carbons of the amide groups provide the highest enantioselectivities with a possible increase in yield. Thus, compounds in which the phenyl ring is oriented in the plane were found to be particularly effective substrates for the PI3P enzyme.  Although the C-terminal position is the most remote from the functional group and also the most important, the second and third in the chain are even further from the functional group and the site of phosphorylation. Phenyl ring users with a trans-ris side chain on the imidazole moiety of 9. 5 were particularly effective in the PI3P kinetic resolution with catalysts 9. 6 and 9. 7 using a k rel k ent-2 0. 44. These data show that an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the benzyl group of the side chain of the imidazole and the amide of the bovine leads to the highest enantiomeric excess of the product. However, aromatic compounds, which are less sterically demanding, were not as successful as the less sterically demanding aromatic substrates.  In order to gain further insight into the nature of the remote side chain, we performed a DFT calculation to determine the energy difference between the conformers of the C-terminal and the A-terminal residues in terms of their contribution to selectivity. DFT calculations point to a transition state with the imidazole as the active catalyst, for which the energy difference for the A-terminal residue is 0. 06. The lowest energy transition states for both the A-terminal and the C-terminal residues are considered in. The relative energies given in are as of June 15, 2007, the latest available data for the A-terminal side chain. The energy difference is mainly attributed to differences in solvation. The A-terminal side chain is more soluble in water than the C-terminal side chain. DFT calculations point to conformers in equilibrium with the A-terminal side chain being the most soluble species.

The inversion of the NMR spectrum of 9. 3 into the chemical shifts of the cyclic diphenyl ring and the acyclic diphenyl oxygen provides an important analytical tool.

      " was ionized by a strong positive charge into an intermolecular gap inorganic halide, which then undergoes deprotonation by a milder base. This process is amenable to several cycloadducts. The initial deprotonation is carried out using N, N-dimethyl-5-oxo-4-pyrrolidine with p-toluenesulfonic acid. The benzyloxy-substituted aldehyde is also available, although it is reduced at low temperature to the corresponding benzyloxy-substituted aldehyde with the same pyrrolidine. The deprotonation of acetaldehyde is carried out in three steps and yields 8a as the exclusive regioisomer.  As discussed earlier, when the pyrrolidine is alkylated with acetaldehyde, the desired product is 5a, a racemate, which is a good starting place for further study. Indeed, the starting material from which these experiments were conceived, 3-pentanol, proved to be reproducible within the range of acetaldehyde derivatives available. In all reactions, for the pyrrolidine to be effective, the acetalkyl component must be activated in a way that eliminates free acetaldehyde, whether this be through loss of hydrogen or through protonation.  We then examined the reaction with a variety of electrophilic aldehydes. Using N, Ndimethylacetamide, N-iodosuccinimide, and N-tert-butyl-2-methyl-1-methyl-1-carboxamide, acetaldehyde, acetone, 4, 6-diol, and 1, 4-dihydropyridine were all examined. In most cases, the pyrrolidine is the active catalyst. N-Bromoacetic aniline may be a catalyst, while N, N-dimethylaminoalanine and N, N-diisopropylcarbodiimide were excellent supporting cast for the asymmetric cross-coupling. The electron-neutral, N-heterocycle also worked well. In these reactions, the pyrrolidine may be alkylated with acetaldehyde or acetone. The free acetaldehyde may be oxidized to the corresponding cycloadduct 7b. Alternatively, in reaction with N, N-dimethyl-5-oxo-4-pyrrolidine, racemate 5b may be obtained as the exclusive regioisomer.  All solvents have been tested in this reaction. A water bath is used as the solvent and may be used for other asymmetric reactions. In general, pyrrolidine is the most active as an oxidant, delivering the product in 99 ee and 66 yield. The system may be easily purified by flash chromatography or may be stored for up to 5 and up to 20 C.  We found that our peptidebased catalyst is a broad brushstroke with respect to substrate scope. For example, pyrrolidino amides 2a and 2b are bench-stable, tunable substrates for the reaction. The corresponding trifluoromethyl amide is racemic, while the trifluoromethyl moiety may be incorporated into a variety of structures, the highest-energy tertiary structure is preferred for all cases, although twist rates are faster than for the trifluoromethyl amide 1. 27 A wide variety of substituents may be installed at the prop-atom to yield diverse products, including cyclopentyl amides.  pyrrolidino amides are also bench-stable, tunable, and easily accessible from an inexpensive commercial source. For this reason, we have developed a unique, interfunctional catalyst that may be used to accelerate the rate of ring construction using trifluoromethyl amides 1. 27 and 2. 11. These data suggest that the data presented here may be of broad interest.  In the preface to this paper is a brief description of the studies that have led to this extraordinary result. A critical element of the present result is the use of peptide-based catalyst. These studies have demonstrated that peptides are effective in the controlled kinetic resolution of racemic primary alcohols, and they provide a hint at the interface of secondary and tertiary structures. A mechanistic basis for the selective formation of 5e is not known. However, we do know that the rate of reaction is substantially accelerated in the presence of NMI, possibly due to the orientation of the amide NH.  A possible source of the selective formation of 5e can be identified in the enantioselective case where NMI is used to generate the 5e monomer. A comparison of catalysts 2e and 2f is provided in. The optimized position of this catalyst is illustrated in. NMI may be dissolved in the reaction mixture in three different solvents: CH 3\n",

Importantly, the inclusion of aspartic acid was intended to bias the catalyst away from one tertiary amine, and while this was not the case, the impact of this residue was still felt, and the minor diastereomer was still favored relative to the main grouping. In addition, the catalyst system was designed to employ symmetric -turn-like building blocks similar to the Dmaa ligand, which reinforces the notion that the aspartic acid can be exploited to selectively place one face of a Dmaa residue near\n",

Using the screen data, we generated four catalysts with the general structure 1a.  Each catalyst was tested against three representative racemic substrates 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e, two of which contained a Trp residue at the N-terminus while 1a and 1b were both terminated with Ty, a nonhistidine residue. The final compound was tested against 22 bicyclic racers 0e 0f 11. 1 Hz, 1. 054-1. 49, , which were prepared in a catalytic fashion. The four catalysts were then examined on 50 racers 0e 0f 0000, one of which was prepared specially for this project and contained a tyrosine residue at the N-terminus. The substrate 0e is oen a common and well-studied drug scaffold. Furthermore, since peptide 1a is already calibrated to be highly selective for one diastereomer of 0b, the possibility exists for -turn modification, which could provide additional advantages. For example, the atom-atmosphere-dependent kinetics for substrates 0h are well-behaved, and the oenogeneous behavior of each catalyst contributes to a well-defined mechanistic paradigm. That is, each catalyst supports selective conversion of 0b to 0c. All four catalysts, in combination, effectively differentiate stereochemically matched substrates with the known aminoacyl -turn geometries: 0a, 0b, 0c, 0d and 0e. Each catalyst can also selectively form an o-to-t-butoxy-H-bond in 0b, in essence controlling the second stereochemistry in each catalyzed reaction.  With the fundamental understanding of the catalysts in hand, we then turned our attention to the substrate scope. The substrate library was initially assembled to include nine catalysts targeted at different stereochemically matched substrates 0a, 0b, 0c, 0d 0e 0f 0g 0h 0i 0j. However, the library was soon expanded to include four additional catalysts -enantiomer 0j and 0p 0p -in this case, 0r 0p is the R-helical, type I -turn-related catalyst. Moreover, the library was further expanded to include a second-generation lead catalyst 0i, intended to lead to products with the general structure 1i.  0j, 0l, 0m 0n, 0p, and 0q are all examples of catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition reactions with good to excellent catalytic selectivity. Additionally, each catalyst contains a sensitive side chain at the N-terminus, providing potentials for selective separation of the alcohol from the catalyst by its side chain and\n",
      "enhancing catalyst performance in future asymmetric reactions. 0m and 0q are also examples of catalyzed reactions with sensitive side chains at the ortho and meta positions, further increasing the potential for future catalysts of this class. Both 0l and 0p are currently being evaluated in the context of enantioselective conjugate addition to acrylamines, but 0n and 0p are promising in this system.  The initial screens established that pepti-based catalysts are able to discriminate between enantiomers of four-and fivemembered hydroxamic acids 0g 0h 0j. These catalysts were proved effective when reacting 2-NH 4Iso with acrylates, delivering the conjugate addition adducts in high yields and selectivities.  Having established a catalyst that effectively catalyzes the asymmetric conjugate addition of ethanol to various alcohols, we then looked at the substrate scope. Given the previously reported results with Accello-containing catalysts, we were eager to expand the scope of this methodology to include aspartic acid-containing wines. Indeed, this was the initial goal of our protocol. To our delight, exposure of 2-methoxyphenylacetic acidto acetic anhydride and 3-hexanol allowed conversion to the corresponding conjugate addition adducts in high yields and selectivities.

      " highly sought in the context of drug development. The development of novel chiral ligands for transition metal complexes with photonic excitation-induced oxal transport may provide an attractive alternative.  General Methods for the Transition Metal-Catalyzed Annulation of Amino Acids.  We first developed the Annulation protocol to facilitate the synthesis of bis-Rh-containing diarylmethines via a intramolecular Annulation-cycloaddition sequence and an alternative, less elegant approach to the synthesis of R-aryl borylation. We envisioned a streamlined method for the Annulation of benzylic and heterobenzylic amines based on a synergistic cross-coupling reaction involving a palladium-activated carbodiimide catalyst and a p-allylpalladium-Na catalyst structure. While the above discussion refers to diarylmethine, the similar reaction employing a p-allylpalladium intermediate could also be accomplished with well-known diarylivestock -containing nucleophiles, provided a suitable p-allylpalladium intermediate was identified. In this preliminary study we identified a combination of copper and palladium, which we hoped would exhibit characteristics of both a-allyl aminomethylation and a-cyclovoltaic aminomethylation. Comparing the performance of these two catalysts is complicated by their very different capabilities, but it is evident that the chiral aluminum will be inert to reactions with electron-rich p-allylpalladium, while the chiral copper will be inert to Cu-catalyzed CH amination. As a demonstration of these differences, we showed that we could perform the Annulation of bis- 3 with perfect enantiocontrol using a pair of catalysts 1 and 2: copper and p-allylpalladium, respectively. On the other hand, when the same pathways are employed with an a-allyl aminomethyl amine, the desired chiral amine product 4 is formed in 23 selective yield, along with a high profile of enantiopurity correlation, . This striking result prompted us to inquire whether the a-allyl aminomethyl amine racemates could be substituted in this tandem fashion and for the formation of a-allyl radical additions. Interestingly, introduction of chiral amine-based radical species at C 5 to yield bis- 5 with excellent levels of stereocontrol engenders enantioenrichment in the subsequent Annulation event, rather than leading to racemic mako-investovalent metal salt 6. Moreover, control experiments established the requirement for a p-allylpalladium intermediate, with a 7-amido group instead we observed nearly racemic mako-imino-5, 6, with\n",
      "only a slight hint of enantiopurity at the primary amine position. The superior levels of selectivity, the combination of chiral copper and palladium, exhibited by amine salt 6 along with the absence of Cu and Pd, suggest a supramolecular interaction between the aminomethyl moiety of catalyst 1 and the R-aryl moiety of amino acid 2. In contrast, the use of CuCl as the chiral ligand not only leads to racemic mako-imino-5, but also a highly enantioselective process. We hope to learn more about these mechanisms as our studies of this system progress.  In summary, we have developed a-allylsimines, enantioselective Rh-imino-and Rh-amino-catalyzed processes for the preparation of a broad array of iminium ion natural products. Noteworthy features of these new systems include an incipient ability to use electrophilic amines as nucleophilic partners. Our studies of these systems as well as the following process have revealed a need for synergistic approaches when experimental methods cannot be readily employed alone. In this spirit, we have taken significant steps toward addressing the challenges that have created this class of compounds for study by many laboratories, but little has been done with respect to the R-aryl imine structure, the most studied conjugates involving this intermediate. In many cases, there is a need to validate the inherent performance of the newly added or altered iminium species with a range of reaction partners in addition to iminium itself. In this Communication, we report progress in this space, focusing on the coupling of amine and iminium approaches as well as the design of a chiral copper catalyst.

      "-stereogenic centers into a variety of structures.  To demonstrate the power of our peptide catalyzed enone hydrogenation reaction, we undertook the total synthesis of the marine metabolite solanapyrone D, a phytotoxic polyketide isolated from the fungus Altenaria solani. 9 Solanapyrone D has previously been constructed in 19 steps by Hagiwara and co-workers. Recognizing that the trans-fused Decalin backbone of solanapyrone D could potentially block transposition of the a-oxy-center at C 5 C 6, we wished to test this chemoselectivity feature in a complex target setting, namely, three-phase coupling of b-substituted and unsubstituted styrenyl esters. The response was catalyzed by the tribenzyl-enantiomer of trienal 1 in the presence of 20 mol 2TfOH. The product and stoichiometric reagent were distilled from solvent and methanol and dried over Na 2 SO 4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residual solvent was removed in vacuo to furnish the dimeric pyrrolane adduct. The pyrrolane was then elaborated to the corresponding carboxylic acid 2 in nine steps.  We initially examined the coupling of trifluoroborate with styrenyl esters using the two enantiomers of trienal 1a, both of which were found to be poor substrates for the requisite decarboxylative coupling.  While the trienal 1b chemistry provided the desired product with useful levels of enantiocontrol, the decarboxylative coupling provided different results. For example, when the reaction containing 1b and the Nmethyl group was run on a mmol scale, the resulting product was not observed, whereas the Cenal 1c coupling provided a mixture of 6c, 7c, and 9, which were all the usual coupling products. Similarly, when the Cenal 1c coupling was attempted with tert-butylglycine, a highly motile nucleophile at ambient temperature, only C 2 CO 3 was delivered in 12 yield. It is possible that the intramolecular Cannizzaro reduction generates a novel diene at C 5 C 6 via an additional intramolecular Cannizzaro reduction and arylation, but that diene cannot react with styrenyl esters.  Less commonly used precursors for the transition metal-catalyzed bond-forming reaction are thiophenol and thiazole, both of which undergo highly diastereoselective cyclodehydration. 10 In a recent study, we describe how the general thiol thiolate activation of the pyrrole -system provides efficient conjugate addition, and in particular, the ability to selectively functionalize the reactive C S bond of a variety of styrenyl esters. Specifically, we found that the ability to selectively build a C S bond in the presence of other thiols provides a complementary, nonaddictive, yet powerful approach to the construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters with simple R, -unsaturated aldehydes.  We initially explored the use of catalyst 9b to catalyze the decarboxylative coupling of 9, which contains a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group. To our great delight, the use of peptide 9b resulted in decarboxylation of trifluoroacetic acid analogue 10, which is known to be sufficiently electron-neutral to permit of its uptake by most organic bases. The decarboxylative coupling with 9 also provides a useful spin-center shift, thereby revealing that a protic ligand is required to facilitate the formation of the C S bond and stabilize the resultant C S bond for later spin-center shift.  The use of trienal 7a as a model reaction partner with 20 mol 2TfOH resulted in decarboxylation of the corresponding C S bond while providing promising results under an aerobic atmosphere. We then sought to extend these reactions to the coupling of other styrenyl esters. On the basis of the model reaction with 10 mol 2FtOH, we made the critical decision to employ only 20 mol of 9b to enable better chemoselective reaction conditions. Although the preceding experiments required the intervention of an extensive substrate screen, this new protocol did not require a high bench-load of catalyst 9b. Moreover, the use of catalyst 9a enabled the coupling of 9 with various, -unsaturated aldehydes. An excess of catalyst 9b was also found to be beneficial for the coupling of allylstannanes with keranone -derived substrate 12. In the case of the -and -oxy-styrenyl -substituted styrenyl esters, the catalyst 9b was ineffective as no reaction was observed under the reaction conditions. With the in situ qu\n",

      " coupling or aldol conditions. We hypothesized that the aldehyde might serve as a surfactant or a reducing agent, and that the resulting products might be targeted as the bis-phosphorylated, phosphorylated alcohol 7.  Design Plan. In accord with our previous studies, we hypothesized that aldehyde-derived iminium ions should be able to readily undergo one-electron reduction to yield the required enolate catalyst. Primary amines such as 1 should readily participate in one-electron reduction via exposure to an excited state AgOAc, which should trigger a photoredox-catalyzed cycle to give pyridine 8. In contrast to the situation for piperidines 8, we recognized that the piperidines would be less reactive with an electron-rich aromatic system. We hypothesized that inclusion of an aromatic substituent on the pyridine would increase the nucleophilicity of the -CH bond, facilitating a single-electron reduction and, later, a spin-center shift event that would lead to the requisite 3-trigram pyridine core, 12. As a key design element, the piperidine ligand should potentiate both the electrostatic and pyridinium systems, thus ensuring optimal enantiocontrol. Moreover, we recognized that amines should be incorporated into a peptide to confer an electrophile orientation, a structural element that is often overlooked in similar peptide catalyzed reactions. As demonstrated in eqs 2 and 3, initial calculations were performed using DFT calculations 13 to identify factors associated with the B-elements of 8. A survey of library ligand structures identified L3 as a promising ligand, with the dibromide motif L4 and the ester bearing the opposite enantiomer L5. A divalent pivalamide complex was identified that favored the same syn-methine conformation. Next, we incorporated a secondary amine-like amino acid by promoting selective derivatization of an aliphatic residue at the C-terminus of the tetrapeptide. This peptide was proposed to form a polyamidimine 10, which would act as an integral part of a peptidecascade sequence. Indeed, initial studies showed that L6--the enantiodivergent -2--turn motif that we had been seeking after allocating the D-Pro-Aib-D-Ala-D-Pro motif repeated itself in this asymmetric ketone-based imine 10. Interestingly, I could not quite pinpoint the day or month on which the pattern that we observed diverged. However, I could not resist the opportunity to embed an extra i 3 in this peptide, as simple as it may be.  The mapping of the proposed polyadic cluster is shown in. It is apparent that when using ligand L6, a bromine-containing amino acid, the protons that are responsible for the proper orientation of the peptide secondary amine are separated from the carboxymethyl group by 11. 7 k rels. While many of the bromines identified in the cluster possess H 2 or Sh-Pro at the i 3 position, the Aib-D-Ala-D-Pro-PNP dihedral is skewed too far toward the bottom face to easily accommodate two types of residues. Of note is that a number of the peptides identify the type II cluster by virtue of the loop dihedrals of the i and i3 residues, which were calculated using the Hirshfeld model 14. 14 The predicted structures for 7 and 8 show that the i and i3 positions would be within close proximity, presumably through H-bonding between the imine Au amino group and the adjacent amine. 15, 16 This proximity is reminiscent of the NMR contrast shown in 17 when comparing 17 and 13 in the NMR of the same imine. In addition, i2 variations only slightly alter the signal. The most significant changes occur in the i3 position. The PNP rms of 7. 66and 8. 62is, respectively, in good accord with the experimental structure shown in. On the other hand, shifts of the imine resonances at 2510 and 1550 cm 2 seem to correlate with both the measured and theoretical structures. A larger shift is observed in the carbonyl group, with a decrease in both signal and dr ranging from 4. 63 to 4. 24. These observations appear consistent with a -turn motif, a -turn characterized by a prehelical conformation involving two key interconverting ground states, one defined by an Öfning model, the other by a Somers-Shapiro dissociation. We then considered the relative energies of the two fundamental conformers, 14: 1 IS versus S0, which is consistent with both the experimental and theoretical data. A stronger resonance is observed for IS than for S0 because it strains the NOE signals at the carbonyl group and because of\n",

      " Di2-O-benzyl-4, 6, 7-tetraoxo-5, 5, 6, 15, 18 trans-furaldehyde. The reaction was found to be extremely sensitive to both the aldehyde and the alcohol, providing rapid and somewhat random access to different products. Indeed, a prolonged reaction was necessary to isolate the desired product 11, the orange precipitate, in sufficient quantity for quality control experiments. When the reaction is performed with an aldehyde, the normal product is not observed, delivering 5 in a 5:4:6 ratio of 11 and recovery of 5 produces a rather sharp 1 H NMR of the crude product, very similar to the crude hemiacetal that enters the crude alcohol.  During the optimization studies of the poly catalytic system, it was found that both the poly and poly chains offered protection against most types of oxidation except from 4 that comes from achiral alcohol 3. One of the main drawbacks of the poly system is the relatively low NOC level however, when the reaction is performed with poly at 0C, a quite modest 1 H NMR is obtained. Most notably, the addition of minor quantities of water can significantly lower the NOC level, by almost offering an equivalent of protection to poly. At the poly level, a quite mild reaction is possible and higher amounts of poly may be used. On the other hand, the poly offers almost no protection and nearly an equivalent of polyenic acids can be used in the poly reaction. These results provide some evidence that the inherent problems associated with poly are easily overcome with the right catalysts.  In conclusion, we have found that a quite mild and efficient path to stereoselective poly oxidation has been pursued. This approach may allow the poly oxidation seen in fulgidus bezoicini to proceed, at least in some cases, without the need for strong oxidants. The high efficiency of the poly process thus appears to be complemented by a mild reaction with a suitable anionic reagent. The search for effective antitumor and antiviral agents from marine sponge extracts continues in our laboratory.  M. A. K. Guo, D. Yu and K. Ap J. .

Case Studies in Sialic Acid Catalyzed Surfactants and Tissue Remover B. Guo, D. Yu and K. Ap J. Bio-protocol. A fully protected derivative of Sialic acid, 3-deoxydioctanoyl-2-hydroxydeoxysucrose, can be prepared via the adaptation of a chlorothiosyl-tethered deoxy-diC 8 PI derivative with 2-aminobenzoic acid and cinchona-tethered dinitro-2-deoxy-diC 8 PI with a 0. 5-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a 1. 25-mL separator, yielding 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI in 75 chemical yield and 5 optical purity after chromatographic hydrogenation. The enantioselectivity of the synthesis is due to the use of an unsaturated carboxylic acid and an unsubstituted lactic acid, wherein the catalytic carbamate is located away from the substituent. This arrangement provides a large enough buffer area that anionic neutral or strongly decreasing carboxylic acids can be used for stereocontrast. Finally, deprotection of the metabolites was demonstrated by exposure of 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI to diamine and HBr on a Silga 4005 chiral stationary phase. After drying, chromatography of 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI using a C18 Chiralcel OD-H column allowed a simultaneous determination of the absolute configuration of both the crude and purified 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI l volatiles, preserving the enantioenrichment obtained in the original extraction step. These fuels have been used to initiate a variety of stereoselective processes from cinchona alkaloids and oreganoquinones, to increase the solubility of stereogenic carbamates, 24, 25 to enable stereoselective hydrogenations and aromatinations, and to automate the trifluoromethylation of heteroaromatic nucleophiles. Over the past eight years, our laboratory and others have reported the use of cinchona alkaloids as belated electrophiles in the stereoselective alkylation, 7 alkynylation, 8 and carboamination 8 of aldehydes, primarily through the contribution of the stable radical intermediate, but also through the incorporation of a host of well-established stereogenic-ether-rectal stabilizing functionality.

      " studies of 3-aminocyclohexanone, we found that both the enantiomeric diastereo-and enantiomers of 6. 38 could be isolated in the same vessel, and indeed, 6. 40 was the precursor of the present system. Upon treatment with aqueous NaOH, the enantiomers of 6. 37 were able to be isolated by prep-HPLC. The unique diastereo-configuration of 6. 40 was corroborated through X-ray diffraction analysis.  Under analogous conditions, we found that both the diastereo-and enantioselectivity could be enhanced via the addition of 2. 3 equiv of trans-cinnamaldehyde. Thus, four equivalents of 2. 3 equiv resulted in higher enantioselectivity in the reaction of p-nitrobenzaldehyde and butanal with butanal acid. Moreover, each equiv of TMSB in 6. 1 equiv resulted in a 10 en antiomer of 6. 38 formed in the reaction. This is in direct competition with the results observed for cyclohexanone when using 1. 0 equiv of TMSB. As such, we expect that the high enantioselectivity observed for the silyloxy ketone kinase may derive primarily from the combination of a highly hydrophobic, hydrophobic TMSB base with an oxidizing cinnamaldehyde. The higher enantioselectivity of the silyloxy ketone kinase may thus result from a more abundant and thus more readily activated enantioenrichment intermediate.  In the context of TMSB-mediated cleavage of nucleophiles from imines, a report by Schreiner and co-workers suggested that the 1 H NMR data that we discussed previously in the context of imidazole formation. In the context of the TMSB-catalyzed, progressive loss of N-N distance increases the enantioselectivity of the reaction, in concert with the temperature effects that we discussed previously. Additionally, as discussed previously, the inversion of the stereogenic center at the pyrrolidine ring or the\n",
      "terpenes can also lead to the enantioselectivity loss. The report by Schreiner and co-workers was broader in scope and involved a diverse set of reaction partners. However, one of the concerns that remained with this system was the potential for second layer cyclic imidazole to participate in the reaction with six-membered cyclic imine 1 toward an achiral imine en route. As discussed previously, cyclohexanone was the optimal substrate for the TMSB-mediated cyclization discussed previously. When examined under the optimized basic reaction conditions, cyclohexanone provided 60 yield and 70 ee to the -enantiomer or the trans-imine product. Importantly, all of the pyrrolidine rings in the reaction mixture were fractured to produce the trisaccharide product. When the trans-imine was treated with 6. 43, the resulting trisaccharide was observed as a single diastereomer. However, within the reaction mixture, the evaluation of different aldehyde additives revealed that higher selectivities could be achieved with 2-methylethane or ethane- 2 derived 3 or 4. 66. As shown in, when 6. 43 was employed, with the TMSB catalyst in place of MeOH as the reaction medium, the product could be isolated in high yield and 2:1 dr.  The increased enantioselectivity of ent-6. 43 can be better understood by evaluating additional parameters, including electron-rich silyloxy ketone or an isobutyric acid. When the reaction with cyclohexanone was conducted with these aldehydes, the enantioselectivity and yield of the product were maximized. Then, with a low temperature 1, 4-lactobicyclization sequence, the pentanone substrate 6. 43 was cyclized to give 6. 44, although with a reduced enantioselectivity of 55. However, the enantioselectivity and yield remained constant when the reaction was repeated with 2-methylethane. As shown in, the enantioselectivity and yield remained constant when 6. 43 was replaced with MeOH, the aldehyde to give S-6. 45 was added, and the reaction was sustained for 3 min. The structure and relative stereochemical configuration of the reaction medium were also investigated by performing density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP6-311G level. The geometry of the dipole-dipole transition state with respect to -to-atom orientation was optimal for each aldehyde, and bonds between substrates were presumed to be nonexistent. In accordance with the optimized ground state and reaction conditions conditions, 6. 43 delivered a series of three different -enantiomer\n",

The influence of the protic additive was negligible. Finally, the calculated and dihedrals.  The energy of the two excited state molecules was measured and representative data are shown in Scheme 2. The calculated energy difference corresponds to the observed energy of the two transients. The three energies were averaged out to the single energy, which was multiplied by ( 1. 0 kcalmol.) to convert K into kcalmol and then into the next-energy pathway without the need for recalibration. The normalized values of K and H are shown in, and the relevant fractions are shown in.  The relative rates of exchange in and out of the three-state, three-dimensional array for the enantiomeric ratio of 3a were measured and representative data are shown in. Again, the ground state energy of 3a is 2. 81 10 -1. 0 kcalmol, compared to 2. 71 11. 8 kcalmol, the excited state E is 5. 6 kcalmol, compared to 3. 49 1. 9 kcalmol. The half-life of the E and Z is approximately 3 days, while that of the Z is approximately 16 hours. The masses of the minor enantiomer and major diastereomer are also similar to each other, suggesting identical retention times. It is important to note that these data do not distinguish between the molecular details of 3a, 3b, or 3c. The absorption spectra of 3a and 3b were measured and representative data are shown in. In, the solid state E is noticeably reddish in color, while the liquid state E is completely black. The amide NH of 3c is also reddish in color. These data are consistent with the solvation behavior described previously: the solid-state E is completely absent in 3c, while the liquid-state E is substantially more strongly nucleated and electronegative than the solid-state E.  This phenomenon is also fairly common for quinolines and quinoxalines derived from type II -hairpins. The examples from the solid-state Ewaldman and Quensto studies demonstrate that the amide NH of the quinoline is also predominantly RED-marked in the solid state, while the amide NH is predominantly BLH-marked in solution. These Brnsted acid amide bonds are observed despite the low nucleophilicity and pyrroloindoline-like structures from exposure of benzyloxyfuroaryl and 2-methylquinoline to these Brnsted acid-containing peptides. In both of these cases, relatively large proton shifts along with larger absolute values of ee. The largest relative absolute shift occurs for quinoline 3c, which has an ee of 38:62, compared with 31:79 for 2-methylquinoline. On the other hand, relatively small shifts in ee for 3a, which has an ee of 18:75, compared with 16:42 for parasubstituted 2-methylquinoline. These differences in observed ee are consistent with transition state enantioselectivities of 17:82 3a-4a and 19:79 3a, respectively.  The N-methylimidazolidinone catalyst is a well-established strong Brnsted acid capable of inducing -turns in solid-state assemblies. As such, we presumed that Brnsted acids of this type could be amenable to Brnsted acid-promoted glycosylation-Turns via induction. By examining peptide catalyst 4a, entries 1 and 7 emerge as a new class of Brnsted acids with potential for Brnsted aciddependent glycosylations. The first three cycles of reaction were optimized for the two-state solution conformations of 4a. The final solution phase of reaction optimization, in which each of the four possible stereoisomers in turn leads to a different gluco-, manno-, and allo-configuration of the desired product, the two-state solution conformation of 4a versus the four-state, three-state variant. the only difference between the two conformers is the degree of backbone bending, i. e. the more flexible dihydropeptide 4a employs the two-membered bent state of -4a, whereas the less flexible leucine-based analogue 3c employs the three-membered, single-pointed carbonyl -4a. A structural evaluation of catalyst 4a revealed that the three-membered dihydropeptide was significantly more stable than the single-pointed carbonyl benzyl-based analogue 3c. A structural evaluation of 4a revealed that the carbonyl group located at the N-terminus of the aminoacyl substituent has a\n",

      " of the peptide catalyst 6 with Ac 3 O and Dib 3 O led to the formation of 6a, which exhibited a k rel 12. However, after 24 h there was a modest decrease in k rel for all serine proteases with catalysis at high conversion. These results suggest that the post-synthetic catalysts Amie and D-Pro in the presence of substrate A do not induce asymmetric induction. In contrast, Carnas and coworkers developed peptide 6. 36, which induced an enantioselective reaction with substrate A. Under the optimized conditions, peptide 6. 36 afforded a k rel 52 for substrate A. After comparing the data with the author, it was found that 6. 36 had the best catalytic pyridine-Imidate-Activator A in the presence of pyridine-acetyl-L-P and that the best catalytic cycle was set when the pyridyl group was D-Pro. This result was especially interesting as it implies that the best catalysts are D-Pro-like in origin. In choosing a new substrate class to optimize for the diastereoselective pyridine-catalyzed reaction, Howard and coworkers went with a peptide-based catalyst, which gave a k rel 14 with A. The assays used in the assays were developed by the authors using tetrapeptide catalysts.  In previous studies, peptide 6. 12 had been shown to catalyze the aldol reaction between cyclohexanone and acetone. The aldol product was produced in 55 yield and 96 ee. By increasing the amount of pyridine to N, 6. 12 led to a higher k rel value for the aldol reaction, with a k rel 53 for the aldol product. This result is consistent with the assays. However, upon reaction with acetone, substrate 6. 12 gave a very low k rel of 64, indicating the difficulty of getting a complete head-to-head comparison. The assays using the less reactive ketone was also low in k rel with substrates that gave a k rel of 32. The assays using catalyst 6. 11 were unaffected by the acid by the residue, but the ee values were quite low. In the case of the imide moiety, which gives a very high k rel value, i-Pr 2 HEH and bis-N-HO turned out to give very low k rels. Thus, the choice of the aldehyde aldol nucleophile was not a major factor for the catalytic cycle. However, the substrate 6. 13, which lacks the acetal making group, caused some concern for the catalytic cycle leading to product -6. The authors performed a screens of short peptide catalysts to create the best catalyst 6. 13. The best catalysts consist of both a N-terminal Pro residue and a -benzyl amide. A split-pool peptide 6. 14 was found to be the most effective with a k rel 49. Furthermore, 6. 14 afforded a k rel 53 for the aldol reaction between 4nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone. The authors observed that, while the best catalyst 6. 14 provided a k rel 50 for the aldol reaction with acetone, the best catalyst 6. 13 afforded a k rel of 31 for the same reaction. A comparison of the two pathways for the aldol reaction with acetone and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde revealed that the selectivity for the aldol product was completely ablated by the presence of pyridine. An Alterscript a The peptide-catalyzed aldol reaction between cyclohexanone and acetone is presented in the Supporting Information.  In order to compare the selectivities for the two families of asymmetric aldol processes, we developed a new test reaction between 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone. In the event, each of the peptide catalysts 6. 9 and 6. 10 delivered the desired aldol product with excellent enantioselectiv- it was found that only the best catalyst 6. 13 could catalyze the reaction with acetone. This result also demonstrates a significant difference from when the aldehyde substrate was an l-Pro, in which the peptide catalyzed aldol reaction was completely ablated by Pyridine. The new pyridine-based peptide-based catalysts were able to address a range of aldol reactivities, including electron-deficient aromatic aldehydes, electron-rich aromatic olefins, and even extremely electron-deficient aryl imides. Notably, even with very electron-poor aldehydes, the peptide catalyzed aldol reaction could be conducted with good selectivity, giving high k rel values even for a range of aldehyde mutants.

      "able a single atropisomer may result, even if the axis of chirality is set.  The advantage of catalyst-controlled stereodynamic networks is that, after the many possible stereoisomers have been studied, stereochemical information concerning many systems may be extracted. Thus, it may be that we will eventually be able to develop catalysts that specifically insert into the networks in a manner that maximizes enantioselectivity. If so, this would be an enantioselective process.  Although dynamic kinetic resolutions of substrates are a commonplace in chemical synthesis, the approach to this problem often involves first designing a catalyst and then executing the reaction from a substrate-controlled perspective. Often, this involves the choice of starting material androgen substituents on the same catalyst. In the realm of peptide-based catalysts, both high achievers and strugglers strive for accelerated reaction rates and enantioselectivities. Decarboxylative moieties are among the most prevalent structural elements found in peptide-based catalysts. Perhaps this is why the field seems so keen to explore alternative, faster strategies to access these materials. Indeed, the quest for noncovalent interactions between catalysts and substrates has, so far, focused on the utilization of co-catalysts. Co-Catalysts Interact with a Catalyst a a Isolated yield. b Determined by chiral HPLC analysis of product relative to an appropriate racemic sample anti isomer t r 22. 2 min, anti isomer t r 6. 9 min, syn isomers t r major16. 6 min. c Determined by NMR spectroscopy C dog.  The application of noncovalent interactions to the enantioselective synthesis of peptide-based catalysts is a field that is gaining momentum. The challenges associated with this approach include practically all of the following: the choice of catalyst type, the nature of the catalyst structure, the physical constraints of the substrate, and the energetics of the reactions in it are largely governed by the flexibility of the catalyst structure. Recent studies by our group and others have demonstrated that some catalysts exhibit only a partial switching capacity for acylation of certain substrates. With peptides, for example, it has been found that some are capable, upon transformation, of forming different enantiomers of the same catalyst. Consequently, a mechanistic model has been developed that accounts for the notable exception wherein catalyst selectivity is actually affected by the mirroring of the substrate.  In the course of catalyst optimization, a curious result stood out as a function of the chiral catalyst: the enantiomerization of substrate A resulted in slightly higher e. es. , but at the expense of yield. Enantiomerization of substrate B, upon conversion to the corresponding monomer, led to a further erosion in e. es. The observation that both high-and low-selectivity catalysts exhibit dramatically different d. es. , d. r. , and h. e. , d. r. , is in accord with the prior hypotheses regarding the mode of catalyst and substrate interaction.  The results inrepresent one catalyst and three substrate variants; the low-selectivity catalyst in question is a complex mixture of many components, many of which provide only limited information on the stereochemical configuration of the components in the reaction. Moreover, the responses to the specific questions raised by the authors are littered with products of overconversion and a multitude of byproducts derived from the reaction mixture. Nonetheless, the quest for absolute information remains a valid and powerful approach to catalyst design and study.  In the remainder of this article, we provide a brief review of the use of peptide-based catalysts for the modification of quinhydrones. For this purpose, we focus on the simple BINOLderived CPAs, the phosphate esters having a bearing structural element as well as conformational flexibility, and the N-arylation of quinhydrones 1, 2, and 3. We briefly discuss the history and development of these catalysts, their performance in the highly selective and selective the performance of these catalysts was empirically determined using multiple competitive quinhydrone reactions, including asymmetric and general anhydrides of substrates like 4. We then demonstrate the utility of these catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of natural products containing multiple alkene functional groups in a bid to demonstrate the one-pot, one-pot nucleophilic activation of phosphines.  The results, presented herein, are primarily based on NMR and chemical evidence. However, we also performed a series of controlled catalyst comparisons and NMR experiments, and these experiments are presented herein.  At the beginning of the study, we evaluated the catalyst design philosophy and the limited set of targets that were part of our initial premise, some of which we envisioned to lead to catalysts that also exhibited flexibility. We chose 20 chiral catalysts, including 5, 7- and 11 Ch-variants,\n",

      "5a, with the primary alcohol of 1a and the secondary alcohol of 4a. For clarification, the O-acetate of 4a provides an enantiomeric ratio of 53:47. Rapid equilibration of 3a and or -4a in the presence of a tertiary alcohol results in a dramatic enantioselectivity difference, with the -enantiomer of 5a dominating. The primary alcohol of the -enantiomer of 5a thus serves as a key intermediate in the stereochemistry of our substrate, shaping the eventual decision of diastereomers at the stereogenic center of this stereocenter.  The mechanism of many of these peptidic reactions is currently unknown, yet soluble catalysts based on secondary structure such as D-Pro-Aib-D-Ala-D-Pro-Asn-D-Ala-OMe are useful substrates for classes that typically exhibit high enantiomeric preference. Additionally, 30 and 31 show that retention times of up to 100 ms are achievable for the same low temperature peptide catalyst.  Peptides that exhibit enantiomeric structures and associated structures while in solution, along with conformer-selective crystal structures, are emerging as important targets for the development of additional enantiomer-selective reactions. Interactions between peptides and their corresponding dihedral derivatives are prevalent in catalysis, and improvements in specific reaction outcomes can greatly increase the efficiency of the catalyst and thus the yield of the selectivity.  Our catalyst optimization began with an assessment of the common D-Pro-Aib-D-Pro motifvoices of 5a, measuring the incorporation of either L-or D-Pro in 5a, inter alia. The relative energies of the dihedral vectors of 5a were examined from X-ray crystallography using the program AMIGO written in our lab. The results for peptide 5b are reported in. Linear regression analysis of the data provides plots of constant:maximum deviation, as well as line widths of interresidue interactions. These data are suggestive of a type II -turn in 5b, with a degree of backbone bending. We also note the strong correlation between the enantioselectivity and the primary structure of peptide or catalyst. These observations were made in agreement with our prior conceptual drawings of 5a. While conformer 5b is not a particularly rigid structure, it is notable that 5a is able to adopt such conformations despite its pronounced -turn.  Upon evaluating the influence of the second residue on the interresidue dihedral, a trend between the enantioselectivity and the degree of backbone bending:entangled quinazolinone 1b was found to give the corresponding alkylated product 2b in 58 yield, with 91:9 enantiomeric ratio. Similarly, peptide 5c was similarly er of 2b with the opposite sense of diastereoinduction. These observations may suggest that the second residue is playing a role in the selective bromination of 5b. Upon looking at the amino acids of 5a, it was apparent that the catalytic N-oxysubstitution pattern is quite important to enantioinduction. This is, for example, a significant deviation from the result withmethyl:sylfuran 5b. On the basis of the assumption that 5a may adopt a b-turn while 5b may be in fact a purerform, the proportions of 6a-6b and 5c may be said to be one in the same direction regarding the initial interresidue. This trend may reflect a unique interaction between 5a and 6a in which the former is oriented in close proximity to the peptide backbone, the latter potentially vulnerable to substrate hydrolysis.  Having identified peptide 5a as a catalyst for the reductive bromination of 5a, we made use of this catalyst to attempt to modify the enantioselectivity with regards to the site-selective debromination of a different substrate. In the case of farnesian, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides, products 2a4ae were obtained with good enantiomeric ratios, and sufficient amounts of both 5a-5b and 5c. It was noted that there was a modest change in the magnitude of the signal when the achiral catalyst CloCl 2 was used, with the Glu residue tending to define the signal. The association of Glu with 5a was noted and corrected by using another set of values for the same reaction.  Having identified an effective catalyst, we were able to increase the selectivity somewhat, as the -enantiomer of 5a now favored the formation of 2a instead\n",

      "antly the use of an external reductant, I nhibiting the formation of ketimine intermediates.  Experiments that probe the scope of the ketone component have revealed that a variety of four-, five-, and six-membered cyclic ketones are well-tolerated in this enantioselective catalytic protocol. As revealed in, these mild reaction conditions are compatible with both aromatic and aliphatic substituted ketones. Moreover, this catalytic platform is tolerant of the steric demands of the carbonyl substrate, providing access to a variety of common organocatalytic products. To demonstrate the preparative utility, the addition of N-methylacetophenone to cinnamaldehyde was performed on a 25 mmol scale with catalyst 1d to afford -3 in 93 ee.  The capacity to rapidly identify catalysts for enantioselective kinetic resolution with simple ketone substrates may serve to facilitate catalyst diversification. Such approaches will likely be broadly useful in developing stereoselective catalysts that apply throughout the vast diversity-policophile space of organic molecules.  The next step in this catalytic cycle is the catalytic turnover of the catalytic cycle. When catalyst 1 is brought to the ground-state Analogue catalysis, epoxidation occurs with the formation of epoxide as the irreversible and reversible product of two-catalyst conjugate addition events. In contrast, when the same catalyst is exposed to an asymmetric epoxidation reaction, the epoxide product can be obtained as the irreversible product of two-catalyst oxidation events, with concomitant formation of ketimine.  Having examined the catalytic cycle in motion, and with the cooperation of the metal-based catalysts and the organic components present, we next examined the organic catalysts for kinetic resolution of the complex. The search for an organocatalyst that could effect the kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols led to the discovery of nanodepoxy-and exo-substi-omeric catalyst 4, each with very different reactivity patterns and very different reactivity patterns associated with them. In particular, catalyst 4 gave a k rel 8. 2 in the kinetic resolution of substrate 5 with aminoalcohol 6. Once again, the catalyst has an appointed time and place in the catalytic cycle which cannot be altered. Conversely, peptide catalyst 10, with the N-methyl amide functionality at the same position, showed a drastic change in reactivity which was almost imperceptible to catalyst 4. Peptide 10, however, demonstrated a dramatic and very different change in reactivity when exposed to enzymatic activity. Within this particular substrate, the putative catalytic cycle was invented.  The extraordinary enantioselectivity exhibited by peptide 10 and 27 raises the question: Could it be the consequence of a direct targeting of a hydroxyl group in a position of the tertiary alcohol On the basis of density functional theory calculations the bond may be able to be preserved. If not, an energetic preference for reaction of the C-H bond may be the fatal flaw in catalytic efficiency. With the optimized conditions in hand, we then turned our attention to the critical question of whether or not the optimized catalytic system could proceed to the synthetic execution.  Our computations determined that the bond length and geometric features of 11 could be altered in the presence of different ligands. The figure shows a line growth of 0. 96 followed by an exponential decay to 0. 84 followed by an exponential increase to 0. 72 followed by an exponential decrease. In other reactions we have studied employing functional groups as the subject of reversible oxidations, the calculated and predicted outcomes are summarized in. The optimized transition states for the formation of the enantiomer appear to be divergent but are almost the same in terms of the energetic preference for formation of the enantiomer and subsequent loss of the benzylic. The divergence is consistent with a more extended aromatic system in which the minor enantiomer is favored. This may result in a steric effect, as the phosphate anion may function to shorten the bond and still lead to racemic products. Additional studies have shown the viability of the favored enantiomer in the oxidation reactions. With these considerations in mind, several optimized solvent effects were identified, and the subtleties detailed herein may be useful for understanding the basis of the enantioselectivity trends.  The first consideration in designing a solvent effectuated reaction was the relative solvent accessibility to the reaction partners. The energy required to flip the bond from H- to N-H is 5. 3 kcalmol, and the bond is so remote that it is not sterically accessible, or at least not within the grasp of the bonding interactions.  When the functional group selectivity is the same, but the solvent effects are distinct, the difference in reactive intermediate enantiomerism is revealed to be 11. 7 kcalmol in the ASE reaction compared to 4. 1 kcalmol in the RT reaction\n",

The enantiohypophysiological properties of cannabinoids remain an important focus in medicinal chemistry, and a variety of different enantiomeric products have been developed for specific purposes such as resynthesis, replacement of volatile organic remnants, improvement of structureactivity, and biosynthesis. Most of these enantioenriched derivatives contain a dual-coupling mechanism to shorten linear propylene rings, which is a fairly common functional group amongst pharmace molecules. However, the independent synthesis of strong enantiomerically enriched tetrahydrofuran-containing compounds from poly analogues remains a Challenge in light of the substantial differences in the enantiomeric preference of the various functional groups present in most naturally occurring polyols. Challenge continues to be experienced in this field, as exemplified by the protracted effort to synthesize exemplarily enriched examples listed in. Specificizing steps that facilitate the enantiomeric manipulation can be numerous, and a basic principle of chromatographic addition is often employed. Yet, the general principles underlying the success of Crows purification should be expanded beyond the realm of\n",
      "nucleophilic catalysis and may require generalization to the study of alternative strategies. Thus, the goal of independent Crows-of-the-art chemists remains the independent study of opening of many more exotic chemical functions. Yet, the current strategy does not enable access to such advanced synthetic nicewires to obtain access to such advanced derivatives with a high level of efficiency. Moreover, many natural alkaloids are synthetic hand-tools that can be easily constructed by large-scale synthesis networks, as well as readily available in drug molecules. The establishment of a central nervous system based on noncyclic molecules is itself a development challenge that is not yet fully understood. Perhaps more pressing at this time is the problem of creating large quantities of locally intermediate intermediate alkaloids that are amenable to enantioselective catalysis.  There are some theoretical support for the proposed enantioselective addition of Crows-of-the-art derivatives to R, -unsaturated aldehydes. However, most of these reactions employ an adjunctional mechanism to achieve enantiocontrol, a statistical model that must be fully defined and has not yet been investigated in ageneral way. Lack of Theory-Driven Experiments. Among the challenges associated with achieving an effective antagonism for aldehyde addition by current methods are the many analogs of 4 that exist. To expand the range of products that can be readily controlled, we sought to develop new types of assay for independent Crows-of-the-art that are capable of producing both pure samples of varying functional groups and also allow for the simultaneous screening of multiple alkaloid substrates in the same structural series without the interruption of catalytic activity, as is sometimes required in the traditional stepwise chemical synthesis approach. The new analytical method you describe herein involves a cross-electrophile coupling reaction that allows for the simultaneous screening of a diverse range of alkaloid compounds.  The proposed mechanism for this new R-phenanthroline assay is outlined inThe Experimental and Real World. The activation of enamine 5, in the unsubstituted enal, is proposed to require simultaneous action of both the enamine 8 and a secondary amine 9, each of which would participate in non-equivalent quenching cycles. 10 peroxide as the stoichiometric oxidant would then deliver an intermediate ester 10, which would undergo enantioselective alkene addition into Michael acceptors. Pleasingly, effective cross-electrophile couplings were found to be available in high yields using simple amines such as amine 11. Initial optimization studies showed that high levels of enantiocontrol could be achieved using compound 13, which afforded a nearly equivalent of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in good yields and with some selectivity, thus suggesting that the proposed enantioselective addition could, in principle, be implemented with numerous different enal enal coupling partners.  As revealed in, additional functional groups could be tolerated on the alkylating moiety of the alkylating reagent. Among these, alkynes, aldehydes, esters, alkenes, and phthalimide salts afforded comparable or lower selectivities. Moreover, subambient olefins, such as 103 and 206, were also competent coupling partners, allowing for efficient production of products in terms of both enantiomers. Horn and co-workers were able to achieve a comparable level of enantioselectivity by selectively functionalizing the C3OH of 207 with diethylamine. On the other hand, the enantioselectivity\n",

This study is among the first reports of catalytic Claisen rearrangements of small-molecule substrates and the first example of an asymmetric catalytic Claisen process. In the process of investigating whether diazonium salts might facilitate the proposed Lewis acid-Claisen reaction, we found a combination of propionaldehyde and aluminum that proved to be a very efficient reaction. The high efficiency of the Al-Claisen protocol was characterized by the use of free livero compound 8, which served as an excellent substrate for a broad range of alkyloid and alkyne functionalization processes. In particular, alkyl trans-1, 2-diol was exposed to the diffusion-control heating protocol to furnish the desired adduct with excellent efficiency classification systems of homogeneous or transitional state leading to either syn-or anti-syn were compatible with this protocol. In a more general structural role, this method should also work with any organocatalyst for that reaction to provide an optimal reaction medium. In addition, this protocol could be applied to a range of other electron-deficient alkyl enones and dienones to generate -functionalized adducts for Lewis acid activation studies.  As outlined in, we applied this technology to the synthesis of -cliozinc reagents Derivatives of enantiomeric Lewis acids or Lewis acids are now ubiquitous in daily life and engineering materials. The widespread use of Lewis acids for chemical reactivity also makes them an ideal choice for the development of reaction development. The Lewis acid is also widely represented in pharmaceutical compounds, and their broad presence has made them an attractive choice for the development of biological processes. Indeed, their molecular structure has inspired the development of a number of biologically active organocatalysts. In this and in preceding publications, we have dealt with the derivatization of Lewis acids in a variety of contexts. To begin, we noted that Lewis acid-derived halides could be employed to catalyze the hydrolysis of alkyl bromides. 9 A variety of organocatalysts were explored to provide either activated electrophiles or nucleophiles with high efficiency.  We next examined the use of Lewis acid-derived phosphoric acids in the derivatization of tryptamine derivatives. The principal issue in this reaction is that of Lewis acid coordination to the metal center, i. e. , the catalytic Lewis acid must be able to bind to the terminal methyl group of a sulfide, a proton donor. The emergent idea was that enhanced mobility about a sulfide bond could lead to dramatic conformational changes, through a change in the polyhalide coordination hexane adduct. 10 A number of Lewis acid moieties were explored in this context, culminating in an N-terminal variant that we were able to synthesize to exhibit the desired C3C3 bond reorganization. Accordingly, we showed that in a 1 : 1 DMFH 2 OMeCN mixture, Al as a primary chlorine has been formed, and it is able to act as an HCO 3 donor to the converted selenium ion. As a more specific advantage, this N-terminal chloride is the less reactive of the two Lewis acids that we evaluated, and it was found to be in a higher energy band, which likely explains the higher overall rate of addition. Thus, it is a less selective process to generate an electrophilic alkyl chloride relative to FeCl 3, which seems to be the key enantiomer. Having demonstrated the utility of the above catalytic conditions, we next examined the influence of the Lewis acid on the efficiency and enantioselectivity afforded by this new Claisen process.\n",
      "T he basic idea of using Lewis acids to generate electrophilic alkyl chloride bonds was met with skepticism. However, Lewis acid activation of alkyl chlorides has been successfully achieved with a number of Lewis acid-based catalysts. As such, we felt the challenge lay in identifying a catalyst that would effectively generate a range of alkyl chlorides. To this end, numerous diastereomers of N-methyl leucine and N-methyl leucine were examined, with the goal of evolving from a set of catalysts that could generate either the most common cleavable clip-together molecule in organic chemistry, or a new compound that would be a good substrate for Lewis acid catalysis. As a first step toward achieving the former, we examined the pair of 1-substituted amides. A number of imidazolyl amines had been previously shown to stabilize imidazolyl chloride, and it was reasoned that the more stable amine would serve as a Lewis acid to\n",

      " the--pyrrolidine-2-one gave the aldol product as a liquid aldol product no more than 2. 1 vol of solvent with 90 condensation temperature, 20 and 40 ee. The secret to this success is that the aldehyde has a large intrinsic preference for S-configuration over R-configuration, which was reinforced by the addition of water and dehydroalanine after a 2 h period. In the aldol reaction of aldehyde and iodonium salts, dihydrofuran 3 is formed preferentially, as evidenced by the highly selective formation of 3f in a 1:1, 3:1 mixture of dioxane and acetone, as well as by the product 1f received for a 1:1 all-clear reaction.  We next turned to the construction of the remaining 15 members of the quinazolinone family. For this objective, we began with the preparation of cadmium triflate, quinaldine, asp-chloroacetic anhydride, and hydroxyiodonium cesium (alkyl chloride, also known as LUMO-lowering catalyst 9. Systematic examination of each of the member compounds allowed for a determination of the relative configurational preferences of the aldol product through enantiomerization of the accompanying aldehyde products. Finally, in an effort to further streamline the synthesis of monomethyl products, we eliminated the use of caesium oxalate, an inefficient substrate for the aldol reaction, by making the methyl ester product directly.  Finally, it is important to note that the absolute configurations of the cyclopentenyl, pentaaromatic, and cyclohexyl rings, respectively, were determined by X-ray crystallography from the corresponding carboxylic acid compound. In light of our investigations, it is our contention that the complete stereochemical array of this series was laid bare, enabling precise construction of the desired structures in a reasonably efficient fashion.  Despite the synthesis of a series of models suggesting a stereodivergent outcome, we were unable to conclusively demonstrate the superiority of any of the enantiomers incorporated into the brassin-Champagne catalyst. On the basis of the X-ray diffraction patterns, we were unable to determine if the enantiomers were the more stable form of the quinazolinones and therefore the more effective catalysts. In fact, the only definitive structure exhibited by the brassin-Champagne reaction is the -supersubstituted quinazolinone 1a, b. The other members of this class of natural products were not found to exhibit high enantioselectivity in the aldol reaction of any form. This conclusion was validated by a series of aldehyde and quinazolinone conformers and by X-ray analysis.  In our synthetic chemistry initiatives, we have taken vital first steps toward the development of a highly enantioselective catalytic approach to the construction of each member of this class of natural products. With the goal of developing catalytic asymmetric approaches to these important scaffolds, we envisioned a workshop-style presentation of the structural design of the natural products containing a new, optically pure enantiomer. T his project is supported by the ESER, and its objectives were outlined in terms of the use of chiral catalysts. W ew ere presently undertaking the enantioselective construction of safroleand isoferiras with energetic support from the TMG-PP team. These synthetic efforts, in addition to the research described herein, are aimed at the elucidation of the stereodivergent process of enantioselective aldol catalysis as well as providing a platform for the development of similar asymmetric processes in the future.  Under aqueous conditions, we were able to successfully promote the aldol reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with several different aldehyde substrates. With the thermodynamic preference of the aldol reaction to proceed according to an aldol law of conservation of energy, 1=1 allenoate-1, 1oacetic anhydride and 4-Methoxyphenoxybenzaldehyde were obtained with excellent selectivity. Furthermore, the aldol reaction of 4-fluorinated aldehydes was also possible, providing 1, 3-diols in high yield. The scope of the ketone incorporated in these substrates was also examined. Seismically restricted 4-fluoro-2-decanoyl -oxyaldehyde derivatives were readily tolerated. Also, heteroaromatic substituents that may be desired in drug discovery or materials science applications were readily accommodated. The reaction isnot limited to the integration of carbonyl-containing heterocycles, as demonstrated by the synthesis of the anti-tumour P-glycosyl-related compound\n",

      " lithium as found that. was and 2--opluene followed by BOC 2 O 3 did not improve selectivities. These results suggest that both the photocatalyst and the Lewis acid are important for achieving Selectivities, and that the former may be disproportionately responsible for promoting enantioselectivity. Evidence for the preferential reactivity of vancomycin with the two intermediates is also found in the form of selectivity observed when comparing ascorbate thioacids 8 and 9 or carbamate thioacids 10. These data show that the two oxidation states of vancomycin are significantly more activated than the simple ascorbate thioacid.  Several important observations were made, including the following: The activity of the thioformyl-anion intermediate is significantly more active than that of the simple ascorbate thioacid CoVs may be generated that are not involved in the binding of the thioformyl radical.  Further studies of the scope and mechanism of this inhibition are now underway and will be reported in due course.  The discovery of chemical tags for complex molecules and enzymes such as vancomycin suggests that the field of chemical detection is now poised to expand significantly. The application of chemical sensors to complex natural products, as well as biochemical tags for downstream binding of peptide inhibitors, biological processes and various complex natural products, remains an exciting avenue for the development of new techniques to interrogate molecular structure and interrogate their biological activity. In this regard, we recently harnessed the reactivity of a-allenic esters to create a reactant which upon photoexcitation upon loss of a hydrogen atom and protonation kinetically provides a reactivity-based mechanism for the detection of molecular movement.  In comparison to other widely used detection methods, photochemical tagging of weak and noninteracting groups, such as hydrogen cyanides and aryl chlorides, is relatively new, and a standard yet has been criticized for its simplicity and low reaction efficiency. We reported a method to incorporate a chromatograph type device into a peptide catalyst that would provide the mainframe structure of a fluorescence-activated killer enzyme and thereby generate a fluorescent zone around the active catalytic PTP intermediate. We characterized the activity of the catalytic PTPase mutant and its interaction with a diverse set of electrophiles, including peptides and enzymes. We then validated that the incorporation of the immunoglobulin-G antibody and subsequent protein kinase inhibitor had any significant effect on the activity of the enzyme and showed that the engineered recombinant PH domain is the effective host for the PH domain in killing bacteria.  The introduction of a chromatograph type device into enzymatic or small molecule catalytic C-C bond-forming reactions, as highlighted by recent studies, can often enhance the activity of the catalytic system while decreasing the reaction rate, often through the enhancement of stereoselectivity in the stereochemical sense. In the context of today's catalytic mechanisms of action, adsorption of a single amino acid or protein to a DOM-3 or Grafix-type protease can provide a significant rate enhancement. The optimal conditions employ acidic conditions, which often degrade the catalytic activity, and thereby decrease the energy of the reaction. Additionally, the reaction should be conducted at high temperature, in the presence of numerous small molecules and very little latent damage should occur because the reaction only occurs where the nucleophilic substrate interacts with the catalyst. Indeed, the reaction of a proteinotoxic chemical agent with 8-isopropylbenzene provides optimal rate and selectivity.  The incorporation of immunoglobulin-G into short peptides that form labile thioethers has received a lot of attention as a method to modify the scavenging capacity of U937 cells to produce more potent and selective bactericidal agents. The current method invokes an electrophilic trifluoromethylation process carried out by the enzyme fMetT, which happens readily with some selectivity, depending on the electronic nature of the thioether and the bacterial resistance to it. The labile thioether can be assembled into simple ethers, pi-mosfets, or ketones. These paradigms require a lot of care and are performed in a highly sterile fashion in a well-controlled experiment. The thioether can be disassembled to access the pi-moiety and subsequent oxidative addition of the lactone or ketone to yield the modified bactericidal agents.  The small molecule amines used in this work include a number of commercial activators and scavengers. Most of these derivatives contain an L--dimethylaminoalanine residue, which we felt could target a lot of bacterial receptors. Our design criteria of achieving selective binding of the PI-specific ligand relied on in situ activation of the electrophilic thioether by the ligand, followed by radical deoxygenation of the C-H bonds of the tethers connecting the PI\n",

      " of in to provide a broad array of boronic acids. Additionally, the use of enamines and their counterparts significantly expands the scope of these enantioenriched boronic acids. Perhaps most important, this methodology is tolerant of quite controversial aryl substitution. Previously, specificity-based selection processes were incompatible with this technology, and required extensive modifications to both the catalyst and substrate. With the successful solution structure of 1 in hand, the scope and substrate scope of this new catalytic boronic acid methodology was investigated. As shown in, 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydrofuran 3u, 100, 161-ti-en-1-olcan be incorporated into a peptide catalyst with a -protocol in the presence of 1, 2, 3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. In the presence of a Dissociable peptide catalyst, tert-butyl-isopropylphosphorous anhydride was produced in high yield. The reaction is now highly efficient, and the aldol product is isolated in high yield.  or another equivalent of boronic acid. Likewise, the peptide can be cascacked with boronic acids 2 and aryl-substituted imides such as 3. Both amino acids are capable of modifying the substrate, and different selectivity patterns of the reaction are observed depending on the relative reactivity of the two acids. More generally, as the number of acids and the number of functional groups, the outcome is predictable.  The incorporation of more than one equivalent of H 2 O in the peptide backbone is not limited to just about di-, eo-, and pyribrinal inroles. As is well-studied, the stereoisomeric nature of the H 2 O plays an important role in nearly all peptide-based catalysts. The 6-and 5-positions of the i and i 1 positions are a possible alternative structures for the avoidance of headache-inducing steric interactions. Moreover, even in the solid state, there is evidence for conformational conformational heterogeneity between the i and i 1 positions, as well as between the i 2 and i 3 positions. Thus, the incorporation of additional H 2 O will likely affect the peptide conformation in the solid state. Recent studies also show a strong correlation between the crystallographic main-chain angle of the i 2 position and the overall prehelical twist of the peptide. The more compact, the main-chain angle will likely decrease the rate of the reaction, and the diastereomeric nature of the H 2 O will influence the degree of posthelicality.  With the optimal conditions in hand, we examined the rate of the reaction by 1 H NMR. By increasing the concentration of the reaction, the reaction becomes more intermittent, and in the solid state it may be that there is a steady state of enantioenriched -1 and 1. 8 equiv of -1a. Increasing the amount of water also increases the enantioenriched -1a, and its enantiomer, to approximately 3:1. 5. The addition of elemental reagents also doubles the enantioenriched -1a, suggesting that the steady state of enantioenriched -1a is not as stable as it initially seems to be. The addition of free thiols also increases the enantioenriched -1a, but without quite significant diastereoselectivity. The final step in the catalytic cycle is the conversion of -1a to the target -1a. As might be expected, initial rate experiments reveal that the reaction is sluggish in comparison to the increase in rate with THF. Also, the product is quite difficult to isolate and handle, requiring several precious milligrams of work. However, the challenge is not insurmountable, as a variety of droids and derivatives of polythioketones could be induced to accelerate the reaction along with the desired -1a. Only products arising from reaction of -1a are observed in the absence of droids.  Polymerization and Deoxygenation of Arenes. The final step in the catalytic cycle is the mono-deoxygenation of the AREne. As might be expected, deoxygenations of saturated cyclic arenes are poor, as are neutral olefins. In the face of this challenge, the best result to date has been demonstrated by Enders and co-workers using 4-hydroxyproline to achieve a moderately selective thiocarbonylation of cyclohexenone with an electron-deficient diastereomer, 4-pyrrolidine. Furthermore, they achieved a complementary way to protect the -1a side chain with a cotinamide. Extensive studies in the identification of a peptide sequence that provides effective protection of the -1a side chain have focused on diastereose\n",

      " He was replaced by a methyl ester. The reaction proceeded with 78 conversion to 98. 1 Ci mol, and the product could be isolated in 13 h. Under otherwise identical reaction conditions, triolefins A, A, and B were completely unreactive. These results indicates that the reaction of the first step of the second step is stereochemistry-determining.  With the discovery of catalytic enantiopure cyclization reactions forming highly enantioenriched biaryls, two important issues were addressed: the rate of formation of the new indene addition product and the asymmetric cyclization reaction with imines. 11 Thus, a synthesis of ASX 9a was accomplished with 10:1 chemoselectivity and 21 independent crystalline induction. The reaction was then completed with DBU for 1 h and extracted with phosgene-MgBr in 1 mL of CH 2 Cl 2. The organics were dried over anhydrous MgBr, and the organics were concentrated in vacuo to yield a waxy white solid. The crude material was then purified by automatic normal-phase chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 1 to 30 EtOAcHex, followed by automatic reversedphase chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 5 to 75 EtOAc Hex to yield a solid, dry asciaryl amine containing an inclusive amount of the appropriate enantioenriched from the ASX 9a triol. The from the ASX catalyzed reaction was used as a template for the design of a new catalytic enantioselective ring-trimming reaction. In this new application, a central advantage of the design of catalytic reactions emerges, provided that catalysts can be found that will afford high levels of enantiofacial discrimination across the otherwise identical substrates. In this sense, the library could effectively act as a surrogate for the unique activity of the solvent system, providing an extra level of control in the stereodetermining step of the reaction. The synthesis and kinetic dynamics of the ASX9a derivative 10 were then studied.  Compared to the parent derivative, 10, the er of 10 was roughly half that of the reaction at ambient temperature. However, upon heating the reaction to 37 8C, the enantiomerization ratio of 10 was fully restored to 85. 5:14. 5, and the isolated yield of 10 was increased to 39. It is noteworthy that the reaction was performed at -40C, nearly 20 hours before the temperature change. Of the minor enantiomeric excesses in the reaction, the geometric er of 11 was calculated to be 84. 5:15. 5.  Under anhydrous conditions, the reaction showed a notable decrease in both er and yield. The major enantiomeric excess in the reaction was due to the diffraction of two molecules of the same enantiomer in the hydrophobic zone A 2 -2. 5 The finding of this great er was, however, contingent upon the choice of solvent. Solvents with a dialkyl group, such as pentane, provided a somewhat less remarkable result. With 50 mol of 11, the concentration of A 2 -2 was unchanged. However, in the presence of 10 mol of epi- 12, a quite unprecedented product ratio was observed. In this case, we were unable to identify any correlation between the measured er and actual physical choices of the catalysts. It is noteworthy that the NMR analysis of the same reaction mixture boasted an accurate determination of the distance between the nucleophilic nitrogen site and the proton that was removed to form the enantiomer.  Our experiences with the octapeptide-based catalysts reflected those with 8. In particular, when the lead catalyst was employed in the asymmetric addition of an azide, the results were lacking in our sample. Furthermore, the poor selectivity of the azide product through-space interactions had a significant impact on both the enantiomer ratio and the isolated yield. In comparison, the enantiomer ratio using catalyst 8 had an excellent linear dependence on the amide group. Modulating the size of the peptide group had little effect on the enantiomer ratio of the product -enantiomer ratio was generally smaller than the other enantiomers of the starting material. However, the results were clear that the lead catalyst was more effective in the case of the product involving a substituted aryl group. In addition, the enantiomer ratio of the reaction was worse for smaller peptide groups. We were therefore quite surprised to find that peptide 4,\n",
      "with a free carboxylic acid group at the N-terminus, gave the best selectivity in the addition to an azide derivative. This observation, despite the fact that we were unable to prove it using a control experiment, stimulated us to examine modifications to the peptide.

      " importantly and. The result also directly influenced our decision to pursue catalytic quantities of 3.  On the basis of our initial results, we obtained in excess of the type II -hydroxyester lipids resulted in a 75:25 ratio of 1-3-diacylated 3-di-phenylpropionaldehyde 3-di-myo-inositides 4, 5. This relatively high ratio is also due to the presence of 2 additional carbon atoms in the glycosylated variant, which we expected to yield similar product distributions based on the relative stability of the different carbohydrate monomers. For example, glycosylation of 3-di-di-propyl inositide 4 resulted in 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI treated with a CPA containing peptide at 0C, and phosphate ester 4 provided a similar distribution in product 4. For a number of substrates, the solution to the formation of 4 was found to be obtained with substantially higher conversion than the starting material. For example, glycosylation of substrate 6 produces a product with a significantly higher reactivity than the starting material whereas glycosylation of 7 produces a product with a lower level of selectivity. We then examined whether the results were similar in glycosylation reactions with different substrates. By simply changing the number of water equivalents from 1 to 3, the selectivity is directly related to the switch of the reaction medium. L-diC 8 PI, for example, requires a relatively high level of water at about 1. 1 equiv, which produces a product with a selectivity perhaps similar to that of the precatalyst, 2-O-methylevalose. With methyl ester as the preferred reagent, the selectivity also appears to be established for a range of methyl-olefins. There is a modest preference for the C-O bond isomer 5, which is formed when the reacting reagent is DMSO-d 6 but did not occur with methyl ester. The reaction with cyclohexylglycosyltris, which produces a product with a low selectivity, produces a product with a high selectivity. On the other hand, methyl alanine shows a reaction between the prochiral ortho-substituent and the glutamic acid, which does not result in the formation of product 6.  With encouraging selectivity data for methyl ester derivatives, we turned our attention to establishing the utility of the novel methyl ester derivatives as directed functional group-free hydroxylic catalysts. As a first step, we investigated the acetal derived from 3-oxy-diC 8 PI for directed hydrolysis of glycine.  The development of methanol-based 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI catalysts was first examined using 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI, NiBr 2 glycosyltrimethylsilane, and myo-inositol-3-hydroxy-diC 8 PI as the methanol catalyst. Although reduced from the parent peptide, the 2-O-benzyl-myo-inositol-3-hydroxy-diC 8 PI was. Direct comparison of catalysts 3 and 4 shows that they favour the same product selectivity as 3 and 4. The selectivities of the catalysts depend on the substituent on 4. A variety of electron-withdrawing groups are tolerated on the 4-olefin: methyl, phenyl, unprotected alcohols and ketones can be observed with good to excellent enantioselectivity. Heterocycles, including protected heterocycles and mixtures of meniscatalysts, alcohols and acyl chlorides, are also readily tolerated. Formal protecting groups can be highly useful, as DMA demonstrates. Additionally, -disubstituted aldehydes can also be shown to suppress formation of the less hindered C-O bond, producing a product with a reduced selectivity.  Our final goal was to determine if the reduced selectivity observed in the 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI case could be obtained with analogue substrate 3CH 2 Cl 2. In the event, we found that when diC 8 PI is used as a substrate, a nonselective CH 2 binding reaction occurs to generate a mixture of diC 8 PI isoomers. Upon treatment of diC 8 PI with 3-acetoxy-diC 8 PI, the diC 8 PI analogues are protected as the 3-acetoxy-diC 8 PI analogues. This reaction enables access to the 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI compound, allowing formal access to each enantiomer of 3-acetoxy-diC 8 PI in 13 steps.  3-Acetoxy-diC 8 PI vs 3-Heterocycle DiC 8 PI.

      "ulate for enolization at the ester 3 point in a 6:1 ratio. The corresponding two-enantiomer ratio at the alkene was 25:1.  The results for reaction were optimal for reaction of octaphenyl chlorophosphate with dithiane at 60C, and they persisted well in the presence of 5 additional H 2 molecules. In comparison to the result with octapeptide I, the performance was slightly reduced when the dithiane was replaced by l-histidine. The reaction also proved quite sensitive to a range of the ester moiety in the position, producing dithiane products with an esteric ratio of 50:50. Finally, the effect of aryl group identity was investigated by comparing 2-, 3-, and 4-aryl dithiane with the cismarcin derivative 2, 4-difluorotriate, in which the C2 position is either pure or partially brominated. The absolute configuration is consistent with a hydrogen-bonding network, and the central turn is particularly weak, indicative of a type II -turn. In contrast, the diamide composite acti-nthesis catalyst 5 exhibited great site selectivity for the 6, 7position, even though the selectivity was attenuated for certain substrates. This suggest that the peptide 5 will preferentially form a b-turn in response to a steric or stereoelectronic mismatch in the substrate, rather than a structural mismatch.  The allo-pThr-containing peptide was capable of effectuating the presynthesis of 14 different sucrose derivatives. For example, teicoplanin derivative 15 was formed in an event that was unexpected, and stable when other PIs were tested. Acetate phosphate 16 derivative 17 and glucosyl fluorides derivative 18 were also formed in events that were unexpected, and consistent only with other PIs. These observations combined with our initial conjecture about a specific hydrogen-bonding network that may be possible. For example, we speculated that the amide of the peptide b-turn might be achieved through a hydrogen-bonding network that\n",

The observation of catalyst-mediated enantioselective acylation of glycoindolines together with our knowledge of the molecular structure of the catalytically active PIs, led us to study the reaction further. We became interested in the possibility of a bifunctional catalysis mechanism. This hypothesis was stimulated by the observation of an asymmetric acylation reaction conducted with phenyl iso-butylideneazole as the catalyst. While other catalytic systems had been found to be a success in analogous reactions, we had observed substantially higher catalyst loadings needed to achieve synthetically useful levels of enantioselectivity. With these considerations in mind, we synthesized, for the first time, a peptide catalytic system infused with catalytic activity. We injected this catalyst into a intramolecular competition between several substrates to study the kinetic significance of the reaction. Reactions were run at 0C, and conversions were measured by chiral G-agent catalysis. G-agents were chosen because their efficiencies for the reaction of the other PIs had been observed.

The results of these experiments is discussed in more detail below. When the data are better understood, it may be achieved that these enzymes are functioning through a fidraditional interaction between the catalyst and substrate in the context of a specific hydrogen bond that may be required.  Reactions conducted with phenyl areoglobus fulgidus. Reactions with diisopropylsulfanyl glucose derivatives. Reactions with dithiane or 2, 2difluoroglutamic acid.

These results are consistent with a potential interaction of the dithiane group and the peptide-based catalystand to optimize for a specific hydrogen-bonding network. The significance of this interaction, in comparison to enzymatic catalysis, is unclear at this time. The interaction of the dithiane group with the peptide-based catalystand may also be determined through studies of the interactions between different peptides and dithiane-containing peptides.

      " comparable it. While the authors have revised their initial report, namely the crystal structure of the catalyst used for the atroposelective bromination of 4. 43, it remains primarily their synthesis of this catalyst that is described in the main text.  A particularly minimalistic approach to the bromination of 4. 46 was incorporated into the synthesis. As a result, 2. 53a as the starting material was synthesized and purified as the major product. This synthetic protocol, which in its own right is extremely concise, provides a streamlined method to obtain 3. 53a in 75 yield and in 45 ee. The product obtained as a result of this method contains 5 in 75 total yield and in 45 ee.  While 5. 3a can be purified using organocascade catalysis, 4. 51a couldn't be useful as a starting material due to its low yield and high enantioselectivity. To increase the enantioselectivity, a small sample of the peptide reaction was performed in water and with a surfactant added. Such a mixture is known to suppress biodegradation of 5. 3a. This result is also in accordance with the minimum needed for the catalytic cycle given by the authors.  As shown in, a crystal structure depicting the structure of peptide catalyst 5. 3a is available in. By this analysis, the first two segments of the catalyst interact with each other and with the same -enaminyl radical. The central Pro-Aib-Fpsi-Phe-OMe-variant of 5. 3a is found to be obtained with a high degree of enantioinduction. The differing rates of formation of 5. 3a as a result of the various functionalization of the amide NH bonds to form -amido radical precursors, illustrate the critical role of the base in controlling the formation of 5. 3a.  A sign of the potential utility of this reaction in creating short-sequence peptidic structures in asymmetric catalysis is the potential for new asymmetric catalysts to function as auxiliaries to or as enantioselective catalysts. We have been exploring the possibility of adapting a silyl radical-mediated halogen abstraction mechanism to the ensemble of dipeptides, with a particular emphasis on the possibility of a pK a effect that might influence the upper bound of the phosphorus atom in the nitrogen of the i1 Pro residue. For amide functionalization, we recognized that -amino radicals are traditionally required when base is used as a SOMOphile. 10 As a result, we have recently introduced a method for radical decarboxylation that allows alkyl radicals to be obtained using readily available, commercially available 3-chlorovoluene and tris-isopropylidene latters, in comparison to the complicated and rare scenario of alkyl radical addition to a core structure. Because tris-isopropylidene latters are benchtop-stable, they pose no threat to human health or the environment, even though they can be found in crude and crystalline forms.  Recently, we sought to expand this radical cation methodology to include a generic mode of catalytic activation, namely SOMO-activation. In addition to amides, we recognized that -amino radicals may also be obtained through non-enaminogenic O-methylation of amines. Among a number of immediately available N-Boc-substituted amines, -aminocarbonyl radicals were chosen as suitable coupling partners, a system that has previously been shown to produce -amino radicals with useful levels of enantioselectivity. 11 As such, -aminocarbonyl radicals were selected as radical precursor 1. 2. Here, a series of peptides was prepared that vary only at the i 2 position from an aromatic pentamer to a radical plateau. As shown in, single bead reactions were performed in the presence of varying amounts of 3- 3reversed chiral amine derivatives. A comparison of the results with those obtained with a random sample of the direct -amination of 4 is shown in the Supporting Information. Among the peptides investigated, the D-Pro-Aib-Phe-OMe fragment was identified as a promising lead for the N-Boc-protection of -amino radicals. Furthermore, the radicalcaption of this substrate was found to be a concurrent one-step process in the initial stages of the reaction. However, the direct -amination of a random sample of the peptide library is not straightforward. shows the results of an intermolecular radicalcapture reaction wherein cyclopropyl-substituted amines were combined with a radicalselec-tivity-based AM cell source to provide a bicyclic peptide catalyst.

      " respect.  To assess the relevance of these new BCPs in todays version of selective C2-phosphorylation, we complemented our findings with a review of several well-known phosphorylation inhibitors that have been effective for evaporation-involving chemistry. Among these, there is value in particular for the new combinations of L-Pro-OH group and its enantiomer, which will likely be the most widely examined. The effectiveness of these compounds for the elucidation of phosphatidylinositol C3-phosphate and diphenylphosphate t r 22-37 did not improve with an extended reaction time of 10 min. These results, while providing a certain set of chemical validations for these as yet unknown roles of aspartic acid in biochemistry. In the end, it might be successfully argued that this work does not represent a technological solution to the elucidation of perivostatin, but rather a starting place for in vivo characterization of these and other phosphoinositidyl peracids.  The ability of peptide-based catalyst amines to facilitate enantioselective reactions stands on the shoulders of two important advances. First, asymmetric catalysts have been observed to promote enantioselective ring-opening in the context of phosphoinositide synthesis. Second, asymmetric catalysts provide a platform for the identification of secret catalystsubstrate complexes.  All authors conceived and designed the experiment. K. W. F and A. L. A. P. performed the experiments, K. W. F and S. J. M. wrote the paper jointly, and all authors edited and commented on the manuscript.  In a series of seminal studies, Hillhouse and colleagues demonstrated that Ni alkoxide complexes do not readily undergo reductive elimination at ambient or elevated temperature and that stoichiometric conversion to a less stable Ni system is required for productive C-O bond formation. Similarly, C-heteroatom reductive elimination by the alkene is not only beneficial but also essential for the viability of the high-temperature, zero-order phase processes that generate C-O bonds. In fact, computational studies have shown that Ni alkoxide reductive elimination is endothermic, in contrast to Pd, Pt, alkyl, or alkyl Ni variants, which are 1, 2, 3-trig critical for productive C-O bond formation at lower temperatures using three equivalents of Ni. However, a general nickel-catalyzed C-O coupling strategy should allow for the introduction of an unlimited number of C-O bonds via the use of reusable olefin coupling partners, a protocol that would enable the use of sensitive organocatalytic SNEs on complex drug-like molecules. Moreover, C-O bond formation via C-O bond installation relies on the use of carboxylic acids, which are plentiful in nature. Although chemically robust Ni alkoxide complexes have been used to develop an N-fluorophenylcarbamate directing group, 1 the less rigid Ni complexes are generally less efficient at directing group formation thanks to technical limitations in the usage of water and low surface temperatures. In recent years, the use of stoichiometric copper salts and phosphine organocatalysts has helped to address these limitations, as catalysts such as Li 3 Pd and LiCl have been shown to promote the use of ethanol in the presence of Ni and Ni complexes, respectively. Given the success of this catalytic coupling in ketone and acyclic alkene substrates, we rationalized that copper could be converted to alkene 18 by iminium activation, thereby providing amine 49 in good yield. Although conceptualization of 50 as a single diastereomer was not feasible at this time, we imagined that binary amination of either form of amine 49 would generate a chiral amine that is suitably disposed to intercept a substrate in the subsequent catalytic cycle. This hypothesis was further substantiated by the use of Cu 2 as a substrate for the amine-catalyzed coupling. Initial optimization of the reaction conditions demonstrated that strong complexation with the substrate is possible with electron-rich benzyl groups, permitting bond formation at both nickel and amine locations with high levels of enantioinduction. Moreover, conversion of the resulting Ni-aryl amine 50 to the requisite C-O bond of 50 can be achieved in 7 steps and in 82 yield.  The potential use of R-branched alkyl halides in this synergistic catalysis protocol has been explored. The initial result is that single-electron reduction of R-branched alkyl halides provides an enantioselective method for the installation of -amino radicals. The successful execution of this methodology provides a straightforward and scalable means for the synthesis of trans-and cis-amino acids with substantial impact on drug discovery. Although the alkyl halide synthetic route is fraught with challenges,\n",

      " It, although it can be subjected to reductive elimination to afford isomer 4. 41d. The reductive elimination step is a distinctively self-terminal mechanism, as it strikes a balance between conversion to the anti-product, while at the same time promoting itself via reductive generation of an aziridinium intermediate.  The mitomycin antitumor agents maintain an important status in both experimental and clinical cancer chemotherapy. In addition to being used as drugs for the treatment of tumors, they have been prototypes for mechanistic studies in the field. Mitomycin C has been shown to act through covalent catalysisand as an enhancer of Akt1. The current cGMP analogues, manufactured by the Ma group, do not contain sufficient information on their biological activity, and are therefore a tremendous waste of money.  A detailed description of our synthetic sequence for the mitomycin C analogues is provided in.  Our design plan is outlined in Scheme 1. We proposed that adding a trifluoromethyl group to the R-methylation of mitomycins 2. 41should render the molecules sufficiently more hydridic from which they would readily undergo radical deoxygenation. This addition-cyclization sequence would provide an excellent test substrate for a variety of research laboratories and would serve to introduce an alternative reactivity pattern wherein a different labelling reaction is utilized for different target-specificial sites.  Our synthetic sequence for the mitomycin C analogues began with the cross-coupling of the R-benzyloxy-R-oxygenated carboxylic acid and imidazolidinone 2. 33a. To our delight, the selected aldol coupling responded exclusively to the acid-soluble O-glycosylation of 2. 33a, with no reactivity whatsoever directed towards the more hydridic C-H bond. A highly site-selective aldehyde nitro-Michael addition was then achieved, affording an R-oxy-substituted compound that was absolutely clear to look at.  With the acid-substrate imidazolidinone 2. 33a in hand, we set out to examine the possibility of using it as a model catalyst for the methylation of a diverse series of substrates. The simplest reaction conditions provided a very poor selectivity in favour of a mono-reduction of aldehyde 2. 33a, with catalytic turnover observed. In an attempt to marginally improve the selectivity, we tried to perform the aldol reaction with 2. 33b as a control catalyst. While ketones 2. 34b and R-methyl ketones 2. 37b were also examined, neither was converted into the desired products. The fact that R-alkyl ketones are unreactive under catalytic conditions suggests that the fundamental step does not involve radicalradical coupling, given the low reactivity of these substrates.  A highly valuable component of the catalyst design is the ability to generate an activated radical species that can readily engage a variety of -unsaturates under mild conditions. For example, when carboxylic acid 2. 34a was employed under optimized conditions, the radical cation 3. 34b could easily engage a variety of -unsaturated aldehydes in moderately to good yields.  The modest amount of enantioenriched aldehyde 3. 34a that was formed, in a coupled 1:1 ratio with acetone, was exceptional. We reasoned that the aldehyde would simply expand the range of the -unsaturated aldehyde that is readily tolerated under these conditions and that a high enough enantiopurity would facilitate the subsequent radical cation elimination step. Thus, we opened the possibility of using an asymmetric catalytic approach whereby a different class of -unsaturated aldehydes could serve as the sacrificial reagent for coupling one enantiomer of aldehyde to ketone, thus allowing for the possibility of achieving sitedivergent outcomes in the aldol reaction/while controlling for enantioenrichment in the intervening steps.  Having identified peptide 3. 3, we turned our attention to exploring the impact of substrate-controlled stereocontrol on enantioselectivity. As mentioned earlier, dimethylformamide is a poor substrate for the reaction due to its diminished nucleophilicity. However, subjecting simple benzyl ketones such as 2. 41 to exogenous thiol 3. 13 led to good yields of the desired aldol product, entry 6. The entry 1 silyloxy group posed a minor challenge for the catalyst, whereas the thiolate group provided unbeatable control of the enantiomeric orientation of the product. The role of the alkene was then probed through the use of solvents that mimic the physiological solvents of aldehyd. Interesting observations emerged that the use of THFH 2 O as a solvent or toluene as\n",

      "ive. The structure of the peptide catalyst was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallography after isolation.  On-Bead screening of peptide-based catalysts for the conversion of N-phenylcyclohexanol to N-phenylcyclohexanone anomer 1h required the synthesis of approximately six thousand of peptide products 1. The product ratio of 3. 0:7. 0 was found to be 95:5 by 1 H NMR, and the product ratio of 3. 5:6. 5 was found to be similarly high in dichloromethane as the crude reaction mixture. On an order of magnitude of 6, 7-selective catalysts were prepared.  Approximately 228 beads from this library were tested, including catalyst 7. FTA NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture indicated cyclization of the product using a predominantly regioselective ring-opening in the presence of protonated hydroxylamine. Almost all of the hexose molecules showed NOE signatures consistent with ring-opened state 2. 0. This NMR data was derived from studies of the Novartis reagent as a preamble to the discovery of catalyst 7. FTA analysis of cyclized peptide 7 indicated the presence of both a variety of usable diastereomers, suggesting that both linear and nonlinear freeenergy relationships could be exploited to some degree. 12 of the peptide. On the other hand, two-catalyst product ratios showed drastically different distributions of the 2, 3-disubstituted cyclopropyl ring. Upon isolation of the product, LC MSMS spectrum of the unpurified catalyst revealed the presence of two peaks of the 1 H NMR spectrum, each of which contained frequencies that were significantly different. Upon validation of these associations through back-conversion experiments, it was apparent that the 2-residue was the less reactive of the two and that there were not two singular conformers of peptide 7 that exhibited the same absolute configuration of the cyclopropyl ring.  On-Bead Analogue Studies. The on-bead analogues of phosphatidylinositol-1-phosphate, P- 1 PIP, were studied via NMR spectroscopy in an attempt to glean insights for the structural features that contribute to the unique ring-opening of cyclohexanol 3. It is possible that the observed cyclopropyl ring is a manifestation of a ring-specific interaction between PIP and the inositol ring of 3, a interaction that is not exhibited in the on-Bead version. All of the on-Bead peptides were different from one another, suggesting that the unique ring-opening of cyclohexanol may be the result of intramolecular or intermolecular interactions. None of the on-Bead peptides definitively gave cyclopentanol 3 the way we had observed it, yet it was plausible that at least some of the other b-peptides could do so via an internal Pmh residue. If our assumptions about the ring-opening of cyclohexanol are correct, then this event is indeed a particular example of ring-specific induction: The way we had observed the cyclopropyl ring of peptide 7 was analogous to the way we had observed it with live peptide 11. Moreover, it is also relevant to our efforts that we were able to observe the cyclopropyl ring of peptide 7 in the living phase and in solution in the preparation of natural product 12.  In summary, stimulated by ruminations about possibilities for asymmetric catalysis, we have explored an exploratory mode of peptide-based activation that has been shown to enable ent-14 in a range of places. While these developments raise intriguing possibilities about the future of peptide-catalysis in the hands of human beings, they also create an exciting new frontier in the development of other biologically active functional groups that may be activated selectively through peptide-based activation. We have taken this exciting new approach of searching for nonenzymatic peptides that provide selective interactions with complex natural products in a testing ground that may eventually find a suitable complement to our enzymatic methods.  r-Pmh-containing peptides were treated with an excess of DOP and imidazole and then the reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature for no more than 5 min. The crude mixture was filtered through Celite and the solvent was removed in vacuo to give a crude off-white powder. The crude product was dissolved in DCM and later redissolved in CH 2 Cl 2. The crude product was cyclized immediately after synthesis. The resonant-ring opened product was allowed to be recrystallized from DCM. The resulting crude off-white solution was then treated with DIPEA and precipitated with H 2 O 2 for TLC analysis. The reaction was then washed with NaHCO 3. The aqueous layer was then\n",

      "e 2. 1 and 2. 2. However, our initial reaction with 1 only yielded good selectivity. Enantiodivergent outcomes in asymmetric catalysis are uncommon for nonenantiomeric catalysts. This is often attributed to a lack of stereochemical control in the transition state leading to the enantiomeric product. To illustrate how potent catalyst 1 can be relied on, we attempted to use it to catalyze the aldol reaction between 3, 4-difluoroglutamic acid and4-nitrobenzylidene-2-one, an area of intense interest in the context of the asymmetric health of people affected by ageing. Both the diastereomers were excellent catalysts, delivering the corresponding aldol products in excellent amounts. One particular challenge is the selective functionalization of 2-carbaldehyde, a step that is often required to remove stereochemical information from a negative n ID charge, and to allow for accurate quantification. The reaction sequence also provides the opportunity to add additional stereochemical information, of course with the possibility of additional asymmetric induction. In all cases, the conversion and selectivity of the aldol product were excellent.  The chemistry of the aldol reaction also revealed itself to be\n",
      "extensive with respect to the nature of the nucleophilic component. For example, both dichloromethane and lactone catalysts supported the specific functionalization of various areas of amino acids. Substituents in the mineral supplement also proven to be important. On the basis of the specific interactions maintained the balance of the catalysis between N-and O-glycosides, as well as the importance of the amine-derived catalysts accessing the Krebs 6⁄ energy in equilibration, we can hypothesize that the direct and chemoselective installation of an additional stereogenic center is extremely facile for a wide range of coupling partners.  The chemistry of the aldol reaction also presented a significant challenge with respect to the site of the asymmetric induction. It is well precedented that the concentration of the aldehyde-containing catalyst 1 in a reaction vessel is optimal for domestic and heteroaromatic stability, with subsequent improvements in efficiency coming from catalyst control. However, the situation is markedly different in this system since the role of the catalyst is distinctly intra-and intermolecular, and the products are obtained in a limited fashion. Moreover, the nature of the alcohol nucleophile is also fundamentally different, potentially giving rise to several alternative pathways to the same product category, deepening the challenge of site selectivity. In addition, the substrate scope is also several times larger than what was previously possible.  Finally, the formulation of a successful cycle for the catalyst-controlled installation of 5-hydroxy-theuran carbon stereochemistry was advanced to the successful cytotoxicity of 5-hydroxy-the bladder oil with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity. The ability of 5-hydroxy-theuran to rapidly activate urethane 2 with the action of a copper catalyst, then to undergo urethane functionalization is clearly demonstrated. Thus, the strategy outlined above becomes a multiple-component process, wherein the modication of a catalytically active, enzymatic part of the substrate is achieved through a remarkable coordination attack that effectively narrows the field of substrate acceptor atoms. In the event, a remarkable biological response is observed. In the absence of the copper catalyst, the anticipated reaction with 10. 25a, based on the model reaction, delivers only the antithetical formation of the adduct 10. 26a. As the sample is allowed to stand at room temperature, the major product is observed instead as a mixture of pleural and diol-substituted products 10. 27a and 10. 28a. Plausible mechanistic elements are advanced that support the observer status of the taxane-bound radical intermediate, the asymmetric induction is greatly diminished, and the potential for additional transitions.  Many disease pathologies can be understood through the elucidation of localized biomolecular networks, or microenvironments. To this end, enzymatic proximity labeling platforms are broadly applied for mapping the wider spatial relationships in subcellular architectures. However, technologies that can map microenvironments with higher precision have long been sought. Here, we describe a microenvironment-mapping platform that exploits photocatalytic carbene generation to selectively identify protein-protein interactions on cell membranes, an approach we term MicroMap. By using a photocatalyst-antibody conjugate to spatially localize carbene generation, we demonstrate selective labeling of antibody binding sites within a one-cell system. Theoretical analysis of such bioconjugative groups clearly demonstrates that the antibody substrate, and therefore the peptide conformer that holds the key reactive complex, is markedly altered.  To demonstrate the viability of MicroMap, we generated the full set of chemical tags for protein interactome analysis.  Within the 100 nanometer, the\n",

The capacity of 6-bromotryptamine derivatives to readily participate in imidazolidinone-catalyzed addition reactions.  In conclusion, we have developed the first enantioselective organocatalytic R-enolation of, . Compound 1 was found to undergo the catalytic R-allylation of, , disubstituted quinone compounds with an unusual 1 : 1 R-enolation reagent. After screening several conditions, we developed a reagent that enables the similar sulfamoylation of, , and the corresponding , , -allylation adducts as well as provides unique access to , -disubstituted quinone compounds. Given the importance of these compounds, a close investigation of their structures was initiated, culminating in a highly efficient case for the formal-cycloaddition of 16 with, , -disubstituted quinone 18 to give 19a with 19:1 : 1 anti selectivity. In the end, we were able to further optimize the reaction conditions to afford 19b with 93 ee in only the specific case of, -disubstituted quinone substrates. This result is, to our knowledge, the most selective result of a nonenzymatic catalytic enalation reaction to date. We are pleased to see that, in similar reactions, the complex of 16 with, , disubstituted quinone-derived electrons facilitates the presence of endoperoxide metabolites with high levels of enantiocontrol. We believe that this class of catalyst will find broad application in the synthesis of complex, polyionic natural products.  The R-alkylation using ketones as nucleophiles provides a simple and efficient method to establish an organocatalytic versus aqueous HF coupling reaction. In this case, enamine formation is controlled by the catalytic presence of a ketone. Specifically, 1 , 2-acetyl-cyclohexanone was found to be a competent substrate for the reaction, affording the named product in 63 yield. The et al. Source of this article is D. W. C. M. , S. E. , and H. J. M. The R-alkylation using redox-active, electron-deficient, and structurally distinct chiral bases has been a matter of discussion in the literature, with both functional and structural variations affecting the enantioselectivity of spontaneous reactions. 2 As a result, detailed mechanistic understanding of the genesis of the major reactions is not yet known, much like the formation of new molecular structures.  Along with recent advances in organocatalysis, a variety of concepts have been proposed in the context of Lewis acid activation, particularly in the context of DKRs of oxazolones. In this context, the R-oxyamination of aldehydes and ketones has been performed via the combination of tryptamine and octanal, often employing a multi-electrophile harvester mechanism to achieve high levels of enantiocontrol. The simplest forms of this sequence, although indeed quite common, have been developed within the realm of catalysis. Derivatives of these peptide-based catalysts have been designed that exhibit different structures, and different functions, often as a defence mechanism for asymmetric induction. In contrast, peptide-based catalysts have been developed that are explicitly created by biological structures. The intramolecular RD-organocatalytic complex 20 provides an example. In a detailed discussion, the authors proposed that the reactive complex 4, of which is characterized by a petrolomethyl-containing cyclopropane ring, could be alive and working as a nucleophilic radical in solution, the way that an electron-rich –CH bond would appear to be the most basic and therefore most easily activated. The authors proposed that, after death of the reagents and their corresponding imidazolidinone catalysts, the reacting complex 4 would be sufficiently nucleophilic to add to, via one of the known bond-forming cross-coupling mechanisms, the most efficient pathway would be through addition of the nucleophilic imidazolidinone catalyst onto the ketone substrate, with subsequent homodimerization to form the cyclohexene ring.  More recently, on the basis of the study of peptide-based catalysts for ADD, 21 the potential role of R, unsaturated aldehydes as harbour sites for photoredox catalysis was explored. Using the outlined dual photoredox gold catalysis platform, aryl ketones could be converted to a wide array of -functionalized ketones with high levels of aryl ketone coupling selectivity. Specifically, the required -ality of the aryl ring\n",

      " the this to, we reasoned that a second intramolecular radicalradical coupling might provide a less selective system, one that would provide broadly usable enantioselectivity but with modest dipole moment. The synthesis of 3a proceeds unobtriguously in this fashion through the first two steps. Peptide Coupling 1 is applied to the production of a stereogenic center with intrinsic value by virtue of an accompanying enantioenriched -system. Peptide Coupling 2 delivers a neo-Cope product 3a in 74 yield with a complementarity funded by a modest leucine rate, established by initial work upon the reduction of iminium ions. In this case, we presume that H-bonding with the ethyl ester renders the catalyst unable to preferentially abstract an hydrogen atom from the allylic substrate, which appears to be deposited with the catalyst in a manner that maximizes efficiency. This degree of double-coupling appears to be appropriate to allow for the production of a diverse range of C-H bonds.  Peptide Coupling 3a, b provides an alternative path for the production of an optically pure substrate. The structural motif of peptide 3a is somewhat obscured by the array of complex polychains that have been attached to the protein. Nevertheless, substitution of the phenyl group to the R-configuration at the i1 position of 3a, as in peptide 3b, leads to isolation of 3a in 56 yield. Unabridged ROESY-observed, through-space 1 H NMR spectra, reveals that a number of minor products are formed by a strongly reducing species. Notably, the formation of the anti-product is fully revealed, in spite of the distance between the proton that is reducing the enantiomeric excess and the proton that is oxidizing the allylic substrate. Compound -3b is isolated in 17 yield with a 1. 0:12. 7 dihedral. In this case, a galloping residue is observed over the course of approximately 30 min, thereafter decaying to a nearly 1:1 ratio of products, and diacetate -3a is isolated in 33 yield with a 2. 8:1 diacetate. In this case, a slow leucine addition is consistent with the formation of a monomer-sacred S-H bond with the C-H of the allylic substrate. The diacetate is converted to a glucoside with 2:1 left-hand diacetate. The thioester is removed with a mixture of tris HCl in methanol, thereby preparing 1, 3-diol 4 in 46 yield over two steps. At this stage, compound 3a is isolated with high diastereoselectivity, exclusive C-H bond formation, and the four interlocking hydrogen bonds of S-H, C-H, and S-H are observed. We then proceed to establish the priority of functionalization of the remaining hydroxyl groups of the allylic substrate. Treatment of the saccharide 3a with phenylborinic acid leads to the efficient formation of diol 4 in 96 isolated yield. Ring-closing metathesis employing the Ru-alkylidene 4 proceeds with high diastereoselectivity to give 5 in 67 yield. Concurrently, THF Isolence is employed to afford the active site of attack on the desymmetrization of the saccharide 3a. While the details of this reaction are currently unclear, perhaps an induction in the creation of a radical intermediate there may be a higher intensity of the competing radical peaks in THF-derived solvent. An organocatalytic cycle is initiated by the condensation of amine catalyst 6 with an aldehyde to generate a R-configuration at C-H bond activation. This species then undergoes an additional single-electron reduction followed by elimination to provide an enol that is capable of performing a single-electron oxidation to provide an enol that is sufficiently electron-rich to undergo oxidation. While the relative stereochemistry of the enol is varied, in the end, both enantiomers are formed with the same diastereoselectivity.  Reaction Scope. Enantioselective oxidation of an electron-rich hydroxyl group has been previously established with the addition of Lewis acids to hydroxyl groups. In this context, PyBox ligand L1 was shown to afford enantioselective oxidation of the R-position of cyclohexenone with Guy disulfideto afford the corresponding carbamate in 82 yield. The R-position of the amine catalyst 6 was currently employed as the contributor to the enamine nucleophiles proton balance. In an attempt to further optimize the reaction, the addition of additional La 1 to the Baggio acid salt resulted in increased reaction efficiency. L1 is a major co-catalyst in the formation of enamines a\n",

      " C and, a large array of ketone ligands could be shown to afford good yields under the reaction conditions. Of particular note is the addition of propargyl carbamate. The reaction is successful with a variety of tert-butoxycarbonyl groups, without loss in yield or enantiocontrol. Intriguingly, we found that the reaction is considerably quicker with deuterium developed in the presence of peptide catalyst 4 than with methoxycarbonyl or trifluoromethyl groups. With peptide 4, the reaction provides the desired product in modest yield, and with an efficiency of 41 ee, and 20 of 95 yield is produced. We attribute this difference to a change in the concentration of the mixture when reactions were conducted with 1 versus 1, under the direct light irradiation of 24 h. Product 5 is observed in 98 yield, and 4 is observed in 31 yield. This result stands in marked contrast to the loss of efficiency observed when reactions were conducted in the dark of day. These results represent a striking result, given that catalytic activity and enantioselectivity are significantly reduced in both cases given that each of the compounds under evaluation is a potential precursor to a different enzyme. Furthermore, given that substrate 5 is readily available, one can imagine that either enamine 7 or a reduced analog might be coupled to peptide 4 in a site-selective manner to obtain 8. Given the inherently modest reactivity of these catalysts with many substrates, we were surprised to find that 2-phenyl-2-cyclopentenone gave significantly reduced yields of 6 and 7, and nearly racemic products were formed in both cases. Given that 2-phenyl-2-cyclopentenone is not converted to 5 when exposed to the same reaction conditions, we subsequently wondered whether the reduced yield could be a consequence of lower reactivity of the combined catalyst 4-6 and the corresponding decrease in selectivity. To explore this notion, we prepared a second-generation set of catalysts based on peptide 4 in combination with the general structure 15. Notably, this strategy reinstated the chiraphos dipeptide motif as a functional group. Additionally, each catalyst generated a yield of 6 that was substantially higher than the control catalyst 4, suggesting that each catalyst selectively delivers one of the cross-coupled products.  To test this hypothesis, we prepared a diverse set of N-oxide-like compounds. Shown in Scheme 7, enone 10 was subjected to the optimized conditions from that used in the initial the investigation of enantioselective oxidation of 5, with the exception of hydrolysis of the phenyl ester. Notably, catalyst 11, which was proven to be highly active in the hydrolysis of phenyl ester, with a 94 ee, was not effective with ketone 10 under the same conditions. In fact, ketone 10 was considerably more reactive than 10, which lost activity completely. Furthermore, while 12 gave a similar yield of 6 as with peptide 4, phenyl ester 13 was a poor substrate, with 11 delivering only 30 yield of 6 in a small team. Additionally, the completely unreactive 14 was a substrate for the reaction, affording 6 in 71 yield of the cross-coupled product with a 9:1 preference.  In an attempt to overcome the inherent nonselectivity of phenyl ester 13, we determined that a different peptide might provide site-selectivity for phenyl ester 14. Compound 15 was examined as a substrate for the reaction, and indeed, a peptide-catalyzed process was observed. Peptide 16, with the nucleophilic residue moved out of the C-terminal position and around the side chain, gave a somewhat better result, delivering 6 in 45 yield of the cross-coupled product with a 9:1 selectivity. Aliphatic ketones such as triazolium salt 17 also reacted efficiently, with 18 and 19 each. Interestingly, when achiral ester 19 was subjected to peptide 16 in CHCl 3, no product was observed. Furthermore, compounds 20, 21, and 22 reacted in highly efficient rates, but with lower localized yields of product 6.  In addition to the site-selectivity exhibited by catalysts 12 and 13, both of which possess a C-terminal NH, we also observed that catalysts 14 and 15 gave modest yields of cross-coupled products 6 and 7, respectively, when using the different C-terminal protecting groups. Given the high site selectivity exhibited by these catalysts, we decided to examine other NHC radioligands as potential catalysts. We elected to examine the NHC mechanism for performance given that NHCs can deliver cross-coupled products with similar levels of site selectivity when using Fmoc-NHCs or when using achiral guanidinium NHC family of synthetic Boc-NHC proteins. \n",

With a methionine-selective bioconjugation protocol in hand, we turned our attention to exploring the scope of the Michael addition. A range of differentially substituted aldehydes were found to be minimally reactive. Aliphatic aldehydes were functionalized effectively, while the incorporation of unsaturated and alkoxy substituents has little impact on the reaction efficiency. Trisubstituted aldehydes can be accomplished with comparable efficiency. When alkoxy and unsaturated aldehydes are combined in the same vessel, highly active and highly reactive species are formed. Likewise, trans-1, 3-diols can be accomplished with high efficiency by providing double stereodifferentiating outputs --regioisomer 2, as opposed to regioisomer 1.  We have accomplished a highly efficient total synthesis of a-oxy methionine-selective natural products. A single volume of Wennemers protocol is sufficient. Wennemers a-oxy synthesis using a-oxy-methionine-selective reagents.  $40. 88.  We have found that a highly efficient protocol for the a-oxidation of nitroalkanes can be easily performed using a combination of photocatalyst 1, 4, 4-dimethyl-2, 2-bipyridine ligand, and copper bromide. As long as the reaction is left unsaturated, a, -unsaturated ketones are tolerated as radical anion coupling partners. Moreover, negociateable pieces of unactivated nitroalkanes can be accomplished using this dual photoredox strategy.  We have also found that a versatile silyl nitronate system is suitable for this coupling with nitroalkanes. Gratifyingly, a range of heterocycles such as pyrazoles, pyrimidines, and oximes can be performed easily with this cyanation strategy. Just as chlorinated alkyl nitroalkanes can be used to create nitroaldehyde adducts, we have found that a system of nitroalkanes can also be selectively incorporated to form nitroaldehyde products. In this case, it has been developed that the incorporation of a nitroalkane catalyst is effective without the requirement of organometallic activation. Additionally, nitroalkane-derived nitroalkanes can be obtained in excellent efficiency from an abundant feedstock -oxyaldehyde.  It is important to note that during this study, the hybrid copper and photoredox catalytic systems were not yet widely employed. Accordingly, the reliance of this third catalytic system for this cyanoalkylation reaction has been able to be produced both orally and in its aglycone form. Moreover, we were able to produce this R-alkylfluoroglucosamine -nitroaldehyde in 83 yield without any loss in the enantiomeric excess. As a further testament to the versatility of this approach, we have demonstrated that enone substituents can be used to prepare a diverse range of carbon-nitropropionate systems.  From the outset, we expected a concise method to form the enantiomeric needed for the purpose of our dual catalysis studies. As shown in, we found that a series of simple aldehydes were suitable.  Given the established importance of nitrogen-based substitution reactions in the field of drug design, 20 we identified a number of specific challenges to overcome these issues. First, the short half-life of alkene functionalization led to the requirement for a high catalyst loadingship of 0. 75. As a result, we investigated briefly the use of aldehydes as a model substrate.  While aldehydes are readily amenable to nucleophilic addition, they are typically less reactive and thereby less stable than are other types of aliphatic alcohols. In addition, the structure of the aldehyde-derived enamine is independent of the manfactors employed since the electronwithdrawing acetate results from decatungstate rather than from the protonated enamine.  Interestingly, the choice of the aldehyde-based nucleophile was found to have a dramatic effect on the enantioselectivity of the reaction. For example, while acyclic -butanol gave the desired -vinyl aldehyde adduct in 88 yield, the corresponding -N-butylamine led to only 11 overall yield of the product. The latter result provides strong evidence that the -butylammonium catalyst is crucial for the process.  In summary, we have described the first asymmetric R-carbonyl aldehydeaminophthalimide reaction. Signs of asymmetric induction in the structure indicate that a transmetalation reaction is operative. Mechanistic studies have provided evidence supporting an oxidative addition mechanism. Publicity of this process has been accomplished using a metallic catalyst\n",

      "has 1 the the primary hydroxyl groups of 8. The quenching of the photocatalyst is then achieved by a radical change process from the Ni oxidation state. In this way, quenching of Ru 3 2 results in both reactivity and selectivity for this substrate, reflecting the overall influence of the nickel center across the integrated photorealistic framework of 8.  The third potential moiety that should be considered in this context is the electrophilic nature of the tert-butyl group. For example, some substrates place the tert-butyl group in the hydrophobic region to favor a -turn, while others place the tert-butyl group in the hydrophobic region to create a hairpin. Thus, it seems that the inherent reactivity of the CBr moiety could be leveraged to roll-back the favorability of a -turn via a hydrophobic effect.  Unfortunately, the demonstration that the LUMO-lowering activation of quinoline 18 could be leveraged in this way has not yet been demonstrated. Perhaps the greatest challenge for this goal is the competitive reactivity of the quinoline CBr bond. Compounds 19, 20, and 21 could be accessed through an intramolecular H-bond if the viene were H-bonded to the CBr moiety. There was no apparent effect of the i2 residue on the H-bond acceptor. Similarly, CX chemoselectivity was not improved by optimization. However, CX olefination was found to be dependent on both the identity of the urea 5. 1 and the nucleophile. When ad 5. 1 was used, no formation of 6a were detected, consistent with the identity of the CX base. However, in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide, the desired a-amino CX aldehyde was formed with 5. 8 in a promising 43 yield. In this case, recovering starting material was possibly the cause of the lower overall yield of 6a, as whenproduct 5. 5 was excluded.  Perhaps the most notable feature of this catalyst is its amenability to the functionalization of analogue benzene systems. This was demonstrated by exposing the phenyl vinyl ketone 7. 10 to amine catalyst 7. 14 in the presence of benzyl bromide, or as the amine source 7. 15, did not undergo competitive formation of the corresponding aldehyde 8. In addition, amine catalyst 7. 14 was incompatible with b-branched alkyl buns, as it itself was aryl bromide 7. 11 rather than the corresponding aldehyde 8. As a result, we had to find a new photocatalyst that would be very broadly functional group tolerant and that itself was selected as a promoter of the desired alkylation reaction. In this vein, we elected to evaluate a number of other photocatalysts as catalysts for the alkylation of phenyl vinyl ketones 7. 11. In particular, we evaluated the use of erythromycin, phenyl bromide, cyclopentanone, and tert-butyl-1, 1-dimethyl-1, 2-phenylpropane as photocatalysts with 4-pyridinylbenzene. In comparison to the use of I-Pr 2 Et, the use of 2-MeO-bipyridine gave lower yield, whereas the use of 1-pentene gave no reaction. These results are consistent with the reported photoredox-mediated mode of action.  On the basis of the optimized conditions, we began to explore the scope of the a-amino CX aryl coupling with peptides we had developed previously. As shown in, a variety of a-amino CX aryl succinimide products 8. 18 were obtained in good yields and excellent selectivities. Although no single-crystal X-ray analysis was obtained for 8. 1, it was suggested that this compound might be a bearer of the more unstable b-amino radical 9, a fidentate precursor for irreversible b-bromination. Recently, we sought to address this concern by synthesizing a number of locally achiral pyridines and quinolines derived from 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid analogues, to address any concerns about the potential threat of radical oxidation to the retronaldehyde moiety. Thus, starting from scratch, we prepared a series of 1-aminocyclo-and 2-aminocyclo-bearing a-amino CX aryl succinimides 9. After protecting the initial a-amine derivative with n-butylimine, we attempted to incorporate O-phenyl groups into the pyridine. While catalytic O-phenylation of 1 afforded 9. 2, which was found to be unstable in\n",

      "or: \" and the with at  As a critical design element for commercialization and competitive biological testing, we hypothesized that the use of small-molecule catalysts would allow rapid access to diverse natural product analogs in low cost. Moreover, such catalysts would enable rapid diversification of fragment-coupled polyketone-derived scaffolds, which themselves could prove to be valuable in studying one of the most common polyketone oxidation catalysts, pyrroleimide.  First, we developed a new catalytic strategy for pyridinium activation using a simple amino acid catalyst. We evaluated the catalytic strategy described herein on the functionalization of various N-Boc protecting groups, and in particular, its effect on the efficiency of the C-H bond-forming steps suggested that a biaryl ring-closure binding strategy would be necessary. To our delight, we were able to implement the proposed Methu-Michael addition on several model b-knoches. Initial studies have shown that methu-Methoxy-N-Boc aspartic acid affords no conversion to the desired pyridine in the presence of other catalysts. A subsequent study has proposed that an amino acid-mediated addition pathway may provide a mechanistic avenue for achieving catalyst-controlled selectivity in the oxidation of complex molecules.  With the methu-Michael addition in mind, we decided to further explore the mechanistic proposal outlined above. Combined with earlier studies on EGDFU, in which olefin geometry and magnetic field distributions were studied using separate comproportionate magnetic resonance analysers, we hypothesized that the injection of an amide substrate should generate an activated iminium ion species that is sufficiently anionic to offer assistance in the transition state during the coordination step. In this case, we presumed that such a lumina-tion platform would provide an advantageous interface for catalytic control, while the nucleophilic tertiary amine should ensure reaction control.  We began our investigations into the proposed MM3-HR-2 MM3-Ferroalanine alkylation by examining the utility of the formylmorpholine-anion coupling in the presence of water and NaI 2 PF 6, which, by itself, would facilitate the heat rise to the IMes of the imine. We were pleased to observe that the MM3-HR-2 structurally stabilized formylmorpholine began to undergo chlorination at 22C for six hours, furnishing a variety of benzimidazoles. Global deprotection of the MM3 was then achieved using BBr 3 to provide the necessary thioether in 65 yield.  We next examined the use of nitrogen-based nucleophiles to facilitate the thioetherification of imines using bond-forming methods contrived at the BBr 3-Br bond-forming laboratory by the Hoffmann Group. Preference of the nitro group on the imine was then shown by measuring the HPLC elution order, in which the thioether was first thioenriched to 80 yield.  In the propanation of such biosynthetic precursors has been noted by the Gonzalez group. 12 M pro in the presence of an orthopropyl amine found in 10 c the naphthol were proposed to facilitate bifunctional catalysis. Upon treatment with NCS, the phenol is proposed to participate in a Lewis acid–catalyzed, one-pot process, providing the imine product in high yield, entry 3. Oxidation of phenol-containing compounds to biarylquinazoles was then investigated using an aryl amine catalyst. Interestingly, a DMA-type reaction was observed. In comparison to the parent amine, 2-aminocyclohexylcarboxylic acid was found to provide a significant increase in the reaction efficiency, presumably through coordination of the nitro group to the imine, a feature that is significant to the relative reactivity in such hydrogen-bonding systems. 2-Cyclohexylcarboxylic acid was found to be an excellent catalyst, providing 2a in 88 yield and 98 ee. The decarboxylative crossover reaction was then demonstrated using a modified formylmorpholine to produce 2d in 99 ee and 92 sp 2 -PF 6. For the cyclohexylated following reaction, pentamers 2f and 2g were constructed, along with insertion of benzyl ether and cesium ion. Interestingly, a DMA-type reaction was also observed. In contrast to the parent amine-catalyzed bromination protocol, this carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction exhibits an absence of a non-linear effect, consistent with the involvement of only one equivalent of catalyst in the transition state. It is currently unclear if helical chirality plays an important role in the transition state. To our knowledge, no examples of chiral essences having direct effect in transition state-related reactions are documented. Additional\n",

      " to is a common denominator of the chemical shifts obtained during the chemical shifts from 1a and 1b. It is also relevant to these studies that the most intense feature in the naphthalene system is coupled to the halogen atom, whereas the lower intensity is coupled to the nitroolefin. These data point to a Type II -turn in the naphthalene system, analogous to the Type II -turn in the C-terminal system. Moreover, the very wide range of chemical shifts are paralleled by the minimization of water in the condenser-type system.  With the optimal solvent system employed, the effects of water were studied through the reduction of benzyl bromodifluoroacetate to to to benzyl bromodifluoroacetate. Although the condenser-type system showed little temperature rise up to 20 C, heating a solution of 2 OAc 2 O and TentaGel spheres 21 and 22 had a dramatic effect on the condenser-type system. The temperature rise was around 26 C for all tetraplasic acid-based substrates. The water content in the reaction solutions increased to 3. 5 l, which was compensated for by adding atomic additional Li groups near the sodium positions. The total structure of the methyl ester of propanal with an unsaturated side chain is protected by the presence of two water molecules: a hydroxyl and a methyl ester. The hydroxyl is hydrogen-bond-donated and thus unable to participate in a water-directed evaporation process.  The data also imply that the presence of water could cause the oxidation of the phenyl ester of the amide to a hydroxyl. This hypothesis was not proposed previously by the groups of Lu and Wallace. In their opinion, the water could only serve to induce the reduction of the carbonyl group to the benzyl group. The suggestion that the water could also burn the ester to a hydroxyl followed by reduction is not consistent with the quantity of water required for the reaction, which is limited to very low material impurities. The water level did not appear to be a critical issue for the compositionally stable alkene.  A hydroxyl-directed evaporation process would enable the slow-reacting amide to be packaged alongside the ketone and a glycosidic coupling partner. Such a packaging strategy could also be applied to the late-stage modification of other reaction components. A full description of the logistics of our accompanied packs is described in the Supporting Information.  At the outset, we evaluated the interactions of the substrate with the catalytic system using DFT calculations to discover the key binding pockets. We performed density functional theory calculations to track the relative energies of the various complexes formed during the evaporation of the substrate and the start rate of the reaction between 1a and the radical of the zinc. The efficiency of the C-Evaporation of the substrate was found to be dependent on both the presence of water and the rate of hydrogen atom abstraction from the activated C-H bonds. For example, the highly dissociable water molecules are easily eliminated by evaporation without product formation; However, the dissociation of water in the presence of H 2 O, TiCl 2, and a catalytically relevant amount of NaHCO 3 led to a significant decrease in the reaction efficiency. This suggests that the water molecule is involved in a hydrogen-bonding arrangement with the amide proton, likely leading to the formation of a water-shaped nebbyl compound. This material is believed to be stable up to 60 C for the reaction.  The effect of water on the reactivity of this system was next examined. A range of water-related compounds were examined in the evaporation of nitone. The water-dependent C-Evaporation of nitone to the corresponding carboxylic acid, which serves as the connecting step for the photoredox cycle, leads to a significantly diminished yield. This indicates that water is a major cationic intermediate in the evaporation process.  Next, we investigated the link between the yield and chemical energy of the process. The yield of evaporation of nitone compared to the yield of the evaporation of water indicated that the evaporation of nitone is thermodynamically more favorable. The correlation between the yield and the rate of evaporation immediately confirms that the evaporation of nitone is rate-limiting. The intermediate CO, which is no longer a water-user, is not involved in the evaporation.  Since the evaporation of nitone is faster than the evaporation of water, we propose that the evaporation of nitone may proceed through a secondary kinetic resolution of the slower hydroxy group. This intermediate CO 2 may be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the catalyst and the hydrophobic pockets of the substrate. The hydrophobic interactions between the catalyst and the amide carbonyl\n",

      " sequences, this process is not reductive and is endoevative in nature. Therefore, if halogenase enzymes are involved, the scope of phenol-containing natural products that may be examined is increased.  As an overarching goal in chemical synthesis, we desired to be able to assemble a diverse range of pyrroloindoline terminating fragments that could be subsequently subjected to metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. In some cases, existing technologies allow for selective derivatization of indoles. Among the many similarities between the two major classes of these highly substituted indole alkaloids is the inability of postulated catalysts to readily modulate the wiring of the pyrroloindoline ring. 14 For example, catechol and sorbitol contain three nitrogen atoms in the same bidentate complex, but when the coupling of these elements is carried out with a catalyst, the fragment containing the -methyl ester of the pyrrole indole is isolated as the main determinant of the yield. This low barrier to rotation about the chiral axis of 7 is believed to be due to the affinity of 97. 1 for the -benzyloxy group.  The high energy barrier of carbon-11 is known to be enormously, and is responsible for the fact that no decarboxylative method has been successfully applied in more than a few cases. Several energy barriers are clearly mentioned in the text.  There are several energy barriers that need to be discussed in order to understand the behavior of the matter under nuclear fusion conditions. The first floor of carbon-11 is the pharmacokinetic floor, which includes the weight of the carbon-11 atom, which is unloaded on reaction. This floorboards the transporter, which in turn locks the tube and chamber and then allows the reaction to warm to room temperature. This arrangement leads to a much less stable cation, which is good at room temperature but which is essentially a gas in water. Thus, the hydrogenolysis of 97. 1 is apparently rate-limiting. The rebounding interaction between the cation and the endo-acid tubes, which is dependent on the organoselective hexafluoromethylation of the indole, originates in the slow exchange processes. This arrangement leads to a much larger cation, which is good at room temperature but which is almost gas-inaccessible at the lower energy barrier. Thus, the hydrogenolysis of 97. 1 is nearly constant throughout the process, and the time-dependence of the reaction is, which is consistent with steady-state random destabilization, not the bimolecular equivalent stabilization that is required. These results suggest that the initial formation of the ring is irreversible, which is consistent with our experimental observations.  When the reaction is complete, the fluorinated quinone is unstable and the resulting chlorine dioxide is not absorbed by the resin nor detected by optical spectroscopy. Sharpless and co-workers have collected evidence that suggests that the product of the reaction is oxygen in the cation of 97. 1, primarily derived from\n",
      "trifluoroacetic acid, which is empty of any fluorinated product. However, oxygen is also part of the product distribution, and Sharpless has calculated the energy spectra of oxygen, oxygenated strings, and oxygenated olefins. The dominant Features of the oxygenation of 97. 1 are also amplified in the stabilized oxygenation of ligand CsF as a function of temperature. However, all of the minor Features of the oxygenation of, including free hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and a hydrogen bond, are included in the calculation. The temperature dependent 1 H NMR spectra are shown inE, while the kinetic spectrum of the oxygenation of CsF is included in. In each of the four possible cases, the 1 H NMR spectrum shows a maximum T 1 value that is smaller than the last. These T 1 values are compared to the first-order Poisson scattering spectroscopy values and are found to be accurate guidons.  The general mechanism of the oxygenation of chalcone alkaloids is unknown, yet has been suggested that water plays a key role in mediating the cyclization.attoice alkaloids are strong Hbond chevers, and as such they tend to be better suited to oxygenation than cleavage of the weak Hbond. Indeed, when Boc-Tyr-OH and chalcone were subjected to oxygenation in the presence of water, the resulting b-oxygenated products were not observed, indicating that the strong Hbonding pair with Tyr was sufficient for oxygenation.  Kudo and co-workers have also studied the possible mechanism of oxygenation of chalcone alkaloids similar to 49, including catalyst 22, which favourably gives the oxygenated product 52. However, all of the possible alkyl acid stereoisomers of 19, including 2-trifluoromethyl, 2-f\n",

      "ME, providing the corresponding cycloadduct in 92 ee. Moreover, we found that cycloadditions involving cyclopentanone provided the corresponding adduct 10 in quantitative conversion without loss of enantiomeric excess.  During our mechanistic studies of the primary catalysts, we discovered that enantioselectivity correlated with the magnitude of the ketone addition, a property known as thixotropy. b-Methylglucosamine is an excellent substrate for the reaction, undergoing resolution with a k rel of 28 at 0 C.  Since its discovery, this methodology has been used to develop a wide variety of CO, CS, CX, CN, and CC bond-forming methods. In particular, it has been utilized to develop cycloadditions related to indole, pyrrole, and furan derivatives, as well as a variety of oxidations targeting electron-deficient heterocycles. The utility of photoredox catalysis has been demonstrated by means of the photoredox intermediates observed in the late 2000s, where it was theorized that excitation of highaqueous hydrogen ion forms a excited-state electron-deficient pyridyl radical, which can undergo enantioselective CO, CS, and CC bond formations. Notably, the use of halogen-trifluoromethyl ketones was not mutually exclusive with this method.  T he capacity of fluorine atoms to engender a variety of useful properties in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and performance materials has driven significant research efforts toward the invention of novel fluorination reactions. Over 40 years, the interplay between fluorine atoms and carbonyl moieties has been well appreciated by virtue of its capacity to serve as alipophilic hydrogen bond donor and to act as abioisostere for many functional groups, including sulfur, nitrone, and trifluoromethyl acids. Recently, our lab expanded this benefit to realize a dual role as alipophilic hydrogen bond donor and to act as abioisostere for multiple functional groups, including sulfur, nitrone, and trifluoromethyl acids.  Having established the utility of our organocatalytic fluorination protocol in a enantioselective fashion, we sought to expand its utility in a versatile manner beyond cycloadditions. Specifically, we envisioned that a broad range of aryl and heteroaryl ring systems would be susceptible to this mild organocatalytic protocol. As an effective alternative, we sought to learn about conditions which would be specifically favorable for a broad range of metal types. We found that with this type of protocol, enantioselectivities could be achieved in up to 95 ee IF the aryl metal was sufficiently electron-deficient to undergo single-electron reduction.  In the following sections, we highlight several highlights of our work. For the Pd 4 CuClLiCl system, we were able to achieve an R-arylation of a critically important ortho-substituted arene ring system in the presence of a neutrophilic fluorine reagent. This clear demonstration of the advantages of using a biomimetic electrophile in the organocatalytic CF 3H is one of the most attractive aspects of this new asymmetric protocol.  The initial interest of Tsogoeva and Wei in the arylcycloaddition of aryl allenoates and ketones was stimulated by the 1993 study of Hong and co-workers. While the monosubstituted aryles preferred a cycloaddition pathway, mono-arylation of aryl esters and ketones was less favorable. The 1974 study of Hong and co-workers sparked a new interest in this area as a mechanism of unique selectivity for the arylation of electron-rich styrenes, carbonyl compounds, and imines. It was postulated that radical arylation of the aryl-substituted styrene or indole could be achieved via in situ formation of a 3-electron carbon-centered radical intermediate. Based on this hypothesis, we initiated our investigations into the proposed catalyst for the aldol reaction.  Our studies began with an examination of the reaction conditions for the coupling of N-substituted styrenesand a collection of electronically diverse aryl and heteroaromatics. The use of diethyl malonate as the electrophile has been well establishedit would provide the expected cycloaddition product in excellent yield. However, the presence of an a side product of type 31 is suspected to directly interconvert the enone substrate and would be implausible with ketone substrates. Furthermore, the use of the diethyl malonate was also unsatisfactory since it gave the undesired 2-triyne and 3-trisubstituted products in low to moderate yields. Therefore, when substituted with\n",

      " of/ 16c is the major enantiomer seen in the negative side of the helical, with many believing the para isomer to be an olefinic mirror image of 3c.  Many research labs have attempted to utilize the power of natures catalysts in the laboratory. For instance, many biochemical targets, including Parkinson and OLeary casa-geography, 1 provide a joltronic stress test for the interaction between peripheral astrilides and their molecular targets. The stereoisomeric nature of the peptide-based catalysts therefore often lead to a direct comparison of steric bulk between the different enantiomers. X-Tests of this type are quite commonly performed in polystyrene or polypropionate forms. Moreover, the perturbation of the crystal structure by interstrand permutation is also commonly used to validate the stereochemical hypotheses. At the higher level ofthe kinetic resolutions, chiral enantiomeric ratios can be obtained by the use of highperformance liquid chromatography on aChiralpak IC column. For example, to obtain a paramagnetic ratio in the number of residues polarized by a single bond, a single bond needs to be traversed, in analogy to the hydroquinone anion. There are many, but few, methods that allow the cross-talk between the remote stereocenters. Additionally, the need to traverse this transition further increases the complexity of the catalyst concept. The further-endorsed the amide of the substrate the more remote stereocenters are in proximity to the oxygen atom. Thus, further operations could be required to achieve a high ratio. Finally, since most D-Pro-containing peptides contain a D-Pro as a central residue, further mobile of the catalyst scaffold could make this position less sterically accessible, which may make this site less sterically accessible.  To obtain a more reflective understanding of the mechanistic features that govern this unusual catalyst, we synthesized both an ethyl-and a methyl-containing peptide catalyst in an attempt to understand how these peptides interact with the substrate.  We began with an ethyl-containing peptide catalyst in the belief that the residue would catalyze acylation reactions with the acetamides. However, we noticed that, as shown in, this catalyst does not catalyze the formation of any enantiomeric product. Instead, in addition to producing a mixture of mono-and bis-products, we observed that the formation of a small quantity of each enantiomer was occurring in low, albeit statistically significant quantities, with values of 1. 03. The homologous nature of the Pmh residue also appears to influence the rate of catalyst turnover. For example, treatment of the unpurified catalyst with TBSCl and N-methyl imidazole shows that transition states may be observed in addition to the formation of multiple reaction products. This result demonstrates that peptidic catalysts that contain multiple Tyr residues are capable of differentiating between and within amino acid substrate. Furthermore, the results show that the peptides presented herein may be of utility in asymmetric functionalization reactions. . Optimization of Reaction Conditions. The basis of the high reactivities observed with the catalyst was the interaction between the peptide catalyst and the substrate in the selected reaction conditions. We hypothesized that higher selectivities might be observed in a soluble, rather than in solution. Given the success of small peptides in motions of the substrate; we took these conditions to perform a more expansive kinetic resolution. Conditions for acylation of the bromide were found to be identical in each experiment. However, peptides that incorporate the whole of the bromide in an R-amino acid were found to be substantially less selective 238. A number of these peptides were then screened in the kinetic resolution 9 of bromide 238. Nonselective reactions were defined as those that afforded not more than 15 ee for the treatment of bromide 238 with nonselective catalyst 238. Therefore, the five-membered peptide 210, now bias-fixed, was presumed to be a more selective catalyst for the targeted substrate. Screening of Antiviral and Heterobiral Producers. The first channel opened in nonselective reaction conditions. This finding is consistent with our initial hypothesis that the -hairpin structure is a key structural feature that permits highly selective catalysis. The data presented herein supports this hypothesis. Each peptide screened against cancer cells demonstrated an increased k rel value of 28. 7 in comparison to the control reaction catalyzed by DMAP. The catalysts screened showed great improvement in k rel value such that by reducing the concentration to 0 M the selectivity was improved to 20 ee. Also of Note-o-pThr-type peptideswere the most selective 2530 of the screened peptides.  The nature of the nucleophilic component in this reaction has also been evaluated. The monobromide-containing peptide 4 of 6 is monobromopyrrolo\n",

      " studies in high yields.  After surveying the peptide library, we identified several hits that had accumulated into a library that was highly diverse, containing every permutation of the i1 Pro residue and various minor substitutions. A new library was then synthesized to satisfy the unmet challenge that the i2 position might be better suited to addressing selective catalysis.  Intriguingly, the use of the same catalytic peptide sequence that triggered the initial Ther map presented above resulted in increased yields and selectivities. But, the direct comparison of the non-dendritic catalysts is debatable. The challenges associated with catalysts analogues like 4 offer models for catalyst design and experimentation. In this work, we sought to understand the mechanisms that govern this catalytic process.  Ther eactions were conducted in triplicate and averaged.   Yields and enantioselectivities were determined by chiral GLC, HPLC, or GC analysis.   Reaction Scope. 3a. Ther eactions were conducted with 5 mol catalyst in the reaction conditions. conversions and enantioselectivities were measured by chiral GLC, HPLC, or GC analysis.   After purification by RP-HPLC, rescreening of catalyst 3a resulted in higher levels of conversion and enantioselectivity than the parameters reported for the first catalyst, and these reactions were further optimized via optimization of the reaction conditions. For example, yielding 4a that led to 5:1 Selectivity and 87 ee, and 4b, the alternative peptide, which led to 5:1 Selectivity but lower ee, were obtained. Likewise, lowering the catalyst loading to 5 mol and maintaining the reaction time for all tetrapeptides resulted in improved selectivity and lower ee values. To further demonstrate the basis of the catalyst selectivity pedigree, we examined different peptide catalysts for kinetic resolution of unfunctionalized racemic oxazolones 4. 25. Reactions were performed at 0C with 5 mol and for 24 h. The data shown inthroughoutlines the competition experiments conducted with the same catalyst.  Reactions were performed via analysis of the crude reaction media and reanalysis of the selectivity trends by GLC, HPLC, or GC.  Codons and positions for Acpc-containing peptide catalysts are highlighted in. In each case, the data indicates the relative stabilities of the bound non-dendritic catalysts.  The most active catalysts belong to a group of three tetrapeptides. The identities of the three substituents are shown in. NMR and computational details are summarized in.  The most stable naphthyl-substituted catalysts belong to a group of three tripeptides. shows the conformational composition of the catalysts from the NMR Spectra Database. In each case, the NMR spectra corresponding to the crystalline catalysis of the reaction are found with a sufficient precision to distinguish the catalysts from the calibration curve.  General Catalyst Characterization. All syntheses of catalyst 3 started from the same initial crystal. The crystal was cooled to 100 C for 15 min and then opened to O. The peptide crystal was rinsed and concentrated in vacuo. The peptide crystal was cooled to 200 C for 30 min and then opened to L. The peptide crystal was rinsed and concentrated in vacuo to yield 3. The crystalline peptide was read by two NMR spectroscopy experiments and produced no evidence for a self-assembled catalytic structure. The peptide was therefore confirmed by X-ray crystallography.\n",
      "T he transcript of the NMR Spectra Database 4. 1 were extracted from spectra computed using the same method described above for the crystal structure. The version using high resolution phased Spectra Data Analysis was used to calculate the NMR signal intensity. In this version, the NH and NH signals appear as broad peaks, which is consistent with the observation of the binding of NH and NH together. The NH signal shifts forward in the region reported by Schreiber 6. 9, while the NH overlap in the measurement region.  The structure of the catalytic peptide produced no evidence of self-assembly. T he structure of the first 20 peptides was obtained by scanning the whole crystal structure with a TPM equipped with a photodiode array detector and a CMRAFFIDER vertical resolution model. The instrument aimed at an ionic center in the loop region of the peptide was also scanned, and the structure was found to be relatively invariant with respect to the domain of charge. Unlike in the peptide 3 chemistry, the CT and CE features of the mirror image in the x-ray crystallography and the structure of the left-hand side chain are separated by over 160 cm 1. The origin of variation of the NMR spectrum is consistent with the modification of the binding pocket by means of the four-and two-dimensional ROESY and CMRAFF\n",

The relative amounts of the two PURExpress constituents and their position in the reactions were also adjusted to account for the number of reproductible amounts of each type.  Duplicating the quantity of catalyst was more difficult. The catalyst count for 5 in 9 compared to 10, resulting in a 3 : 1 mix of 51. 2.  Particle sequencing revealed significant structural homology between the DPro-Aib-DMSO chimera and the lysine side chains. Particularly striking, three distinct conformations of 3 were observed in the solid state by LRMS.  As a result of this focus, a preliminary study on the energetics of bromination was carried out. Dropping the response temperature from 23 to 0C resulted in a 10. 3:1 mixture of 5 6. 5, with the major species in the reaction of 1a, which is 87. 6, under ionic conditions.

These results were also validated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, which showed that 6, 5, and 6 were indeed amenable to direct analysis by HPLC. With these parameters in hand, we then applied the optimized non-linear dielectric effect in a single crystal X-ray crystallography to estimate the masses of 6, 5, and 6, which were isolated in sufficient quantities to be used as isotopically labeled compounds.  To estimate the masses of all nucleosides, the analysis of DFT computations on the ground-state structure of 1a provided a reassuring check that likelier peptidesang sympresentations have relatively low MNCS values. 9d, 10 Effective cross-coupling protocols that rely on co-catalysis have also been described, such as the one-pot protocol described inand the multiple-step protocol described in.  The amount of computation that went into estimating the masses of various peptides was a factor-of-two aspect of the equation. For the peptides with mass mz, P1 gives an exponent of -5. 6Jmol, which is consistent with the experimentally observed CMC of c 1. 6.  However, when the naphthyl is removed from the imidazole moiety, the catalytic formation of 5a slows, which may lead to very shortME reactions.  This methodology has been applied to the CMC of several depeptides that have been extensively studied in other reactions. For example, the CMC of 5a has been compared to that of propionic acid..  The ME and NH groups have been included in the optimized transition states for many cases.  To obtain a measure of how well behaved the ME and NH groups have been included, the computed states of the masses of the occurs of a number of closely related compounds have been plotted. A steep linear. Peptide II has an energy difference between the optimized transition states corresponding to the two strongly reducing m states: those of Pro at the i 3 position and those of D-Phe at the i 4 and i 5 positions.  In this case, the gradient is clear. The dashed line indicates the gradient of the proposed mass shift when the i 3 amide group is removed. This could be the result of the proposed as outlined in.  With the initial population data in hand, we focused our attention on studies of the site-selective derivatization of 5a. Ideally, our studies would involve diketopiperazine derivatives of varying chain lengths, as well as a mixture of equimolar tetramers.  To assess the value of Aib-Ser- D-Phe-D-Pro-Aic, we focused on those with shorter ester chains. Stereochemical perturbations were then investigated. When a\n",

      " extent (, which allows the formation of C-center radical cationic intermediates such as 4. By contrast, the previously described dual catalytic copper co-catalytic protocol involves aryl halides, which result in a modest oxidation at copper, followed by deprotonation or reduction. The resulting C-centered radical is then proposed to abstract a hydrogen atom from the C-centered radical of TEMPO, producing iminium ion 11, which undergoes a second SET event with the succinamide nucleophile 11. Hydrolysis of such a species would then furnish the corresponding cyclohexadienyl radical 12 and re-establish an Open-Schuster oxidation pathway. We envision that such a dual catalytic protocol might be of general utility for the acceptance of functions for which a singleor duo-catalyzed protocol would be inappropriate. For example, dichloromethane functionalized with the appropriate dichloromethane functional group will knowingly couple with a single imidazolidinone catalyst, regardless of the relative -chromatographic purity of the resultant product. Moreover, radical-mediated pathways may also be rendered histrally unstable by the presence of certain unsaturated aldehydes. The displacement of the catalytic cycles by a single imidazolidinone catalyst can be followed by a1, 2-disubstituted arylation cyclization sequence without loss of enantiopurity at the benzylic position.  The broad application of the photoredox-mediated alkylation of organobromides has now surpassed the combined efforts of numerous researchers in a variety of areas. Photoredox catalysis has had a significant impact on all areas of organic synthesis, triggered products sales, and, when successfully, have spawned the development of new methods. Recently, our group developed a photoredox-catalyzed method for the arylation of imidazolidinone catalysts. On a multigram scale, it is possible to perform the single-electron reduction of aryl halides using photoredox intermediates to generate bench-stable, molecule-scale functionalized aryl halides.  With the same goal in mind, we recently sought to develop a new catalytic approach to iminium ionized ketones via iminium catalysis. Whereas the classical model iminium ionization reactions rely on the presence of an amine catalyst and nucleophile to enable enantioselective activation, we questioned whether photoredox catalysis could also enable the activation of iminium ions generated through an oxidation-induced iminium ion pathway. Many synthetic models of this process exist, including both a peptide-and cinchona-based catalysts. However, to assess whether such catalysts could be realized in order to access organometallic oxidation products, we first examined aryl iminoiodonium salts, which are ubiquitous in organic compounds. We found that the use of iminoiodonium salts as catalysts for the addition of malonium ions to iminium ions, as proposed in the catalysis of the aldol reaction, 2 provided 2 in sufficient conversion to proceed under the conditions examined.  We next examined a range of photocatalysts, thiols, solvents, and bases in this tandem catalysis protocol. With respect to the potential impact of light-mediated photoredox reactions on this pathway, we recognized that both Feand Bohri acids are known to promote nitrile oxidation to form nitrile radicals. 10 As a result, we chose to examine the reaction of an N-arylsubstituted iminium ion with this dual catalytic system. Indeed, exposure of 1 to the photoredox-mediated oxidant 1d furnishes the strongly reducing Ir species 2, which after capture of a nitrogen atom is expected to undergo a single-electron reduction followed by elimination to provide the unsaturated iminium ion 3. 10 As a result, we utilize N-alkylsilyl radical intermediates 10 as a strategy to enhance reductive elimination of the purchased ketones.  Finally, to combat the inherent photoexcitability of the activation system, we utilized nitrogen-containing heteroarenes within the catalytic cycle. We recognized that foliocarbonyl radicals were likely to be generated in situ via two sequential one-electron reductions of 2 by the iridoid photocatalyst, but that the reduced excited state of the heteroarene substrate 1d could then intercept this functional group to achieve the key alkylation step. As a result, we utilize N-methylpyrrolidine as the amine source with methyl folioborate as the quencher of the nitromethane precursor. 11 Accordingly, we subjected 1d to our synergistic cascade protocol to furnish the unsaturated iminium ion 4 in a single operation.  Having exploited the inherent potential of this cascade catalysis protocol, we next\n",

      ", a second tertiary carbon substituent was required as the C-terminal NH group was expected to by a hydrogen bond with the BST. 16c, The use of NFSI as an electrophilic fluorine source, despite its hydrophobic and acidic nature, was suitably cooled by the 28C needed for the overnight low-molecular-weight charged peptide. While the use of Cu 2 in its unactivated form can give low conversions to the desired T4L product, replacing Cu 2 with the more reactive chloro ammonium salt 11b allowed a significant increase in the overall yield to 85. Also of note, improved efficiencies were observed when the catalyst was omitted from the reaction. The reaction still remained fairly unselective using this method, and it was found that adding the catalyst to the reaction mix after 24 h significantly increased the conversion. This was especially noticeable when the catalyst was omitted while the reaction was running at 25C. Under these conditions, the temperature may well raise the reactivity of the carbene by 19 expelling water, leading to the formation of a super-stoichiometric excess of T4L. In the presence of excess T4L, the polymer core became extremely hydrophobic, and conversion to the T4L product was abnormally rapid. Under normal conversion conditions, the impurity of the T4L product was retained by approximately 10, which is why the low temperature, dark brown solution was found to be the natural product. Missing the catalyst resulted in roughly the same yield however, the overall conversion was lowered to 51.  Optimization of Reaction Conditions. Having identified a catalyst that operates at 28C and is preferentially fed T4L in 81 yield, we sought to optimize the reaction conditions. In addition to the standard reaction conditions, we found that increasing the size of the catalyst requires lower temperatures. We set the stage for further improvements by increasing the equivalents of starting material and decreasing the stoichiometry of the base. Additionally, we found that an essential component of the high-selectivity catalyst was to ensure that the peptide catalyst can cluster around the motif of the high-performing catalysts from our initial studies. To accomplish this goal, we studied the ability of peptide aggregates to direct the delivery of polypeptides into treated peptide sequences. Using Asn. Elongation of sequences. Peptide aggregates. Values in parentheses are isolated yields. Eqs in parentheses are ratio values.  a Results listed as product of converted peptide sequences into the corresponding product of enantioselectivity. b Diastereomeric ratio determined by HPLC analysis. c Conversion determined by ICUC analysis. d Yields based on isolation of the corresponding T4L-peptide composite.  Research Article pubs. acs. orgacscatalysis use of the bulkier tert-Buty-OH was found to be superior to both the bulkier t-Bu-OH and the tert-buty-NH 2 O in all cases. Furthermore, the choice of base was critical, as T4L direct delivery at 20C was consistently higher than T4L synthesis via the previous winter reaction. This supports the hypothesis that the T4L peptide is a viable alternative to the hydroxyl-containing scaffold, while the structural diversity available with the C-Terminal truncation remains limited to a minor extent. That the peptide selected in substitution is not the most reactive when incubated with t-Bu or t-Bu in the presence of Cbz and t-Bu in the presence of the tert-butylic acid still significantly influences the formation of the product. For example, in the presence of Bu 3 O, a 22 yield of the desired peptidomimetic is reached, despite the wide range of C-Terminal substitutions. The fractionation of the remaining T4L product maximized the overall yield, suggesting that the reaction is sensitive to the steric contribution of the C-Terminal substituent. Interestingly, the greater steric contribution of the T4L group is still greater than the corresponding benzylic position, despite the halogenation of the ligand. This contribution is consistent with the expected behavior of the longer peptides, which may correlate to anomeric effects more rigorously. For example, comparative studies of the ratio of the number of T4L-to-T4L products in each grouping showed that the T4L-peptide is the most reactive when just 1. 1 equiv of T4L is employed and the peptide is 68 active. Moreover, the percentage of T4L that is converted to the Boc-T4L product per unit cell is 26, which corresponds to a T4L:D conversion of 75, which is fully mitigated by the pentamer. Thus, both the T4L-and T4L-peptide products have been produced in 57 overall yield, with a mean of\n",

      " these an evaluation of an experimental approach to the synthesis of oligopeptides. We reported that compound 1, a commercially available heptapeptide, functioned as a highly effective catalyst for the kinetic resolution of a series of co-deficient aromatic a-methylstyrene derivatives, delivering the regio-and stereoselective syntheses of a range of carbon-based and organic polystituted polystyrene derivatives in good yields and excellent ee.  The oligopeptide heptapeptide 10 exhibits alternative regioselectivity, delivering monocoupled product 11 in 45 yield with 98 ee. Polystyrene derivative 6 also proved effective as a substrate, delivering 11 in 80 yield with 97 ee. Acylation of the acyloin followed by immediate deoxygenation with SmI 2 provided oligopeptide 12 in good yield and enantioselectivity. SmI 2 also provided some improvement in ee at lower temperatures, while Ca 2 served as a good substrate. The reaction operated at low loadings, requiring only 0. 5 mol of catalyst 5.  We next evaluated the oligopeptides based on glycine. Rather than linking the polystyrene beads to the catalysts we have examined for the synthesis of co-deficient peptides, we tested the oligopeptides directly. We assessed the diastereoselectivity as a function of each individual peptide. The results are presented in. NMR analysis of the reaction mixture demonstrated that the oligopeptides preferred a D -configuration. This is exemplified by the all-atom trans-11 in, which may be lifted up to the best of the catalysts. Then, it is shown that each of the peptides examined fares by a different rate, indicating that the effect of the oligopeptides is modulated by the thickness of the linker, entries 1-5. A number of critical differences between the crystal structures of 6 and 10 could be identified, including the degree of backbone bending. Flip-closure of the linkser between 1a and 11 may also unveil interesting noncovalent associations. Flip-closure of the linker between 13 and 14 shows that both are conformationally dynamic under these conditions.  The all-atom data show that much more conformationally restricted and rigorously defined than is commonly held in the literature. In this sense, the available conformational space is often filled by the hands of designers who desire to capture an aspect of the chemical world fundamentally different from traditional binary, axial structures. This type of language is reflected in the excellent inventiveness observed in the synthesis of 13. Analogous to the fantastic successes we have observed in high-throughput screening of single-beaded libraries, we now look back with yearning over the past results and wondering what the common sense of complementary fits into a complex stew of equilibrating peptides we have observed deep within the understanding of certain basic tenets of nucleophilic catalysis. Surely, many concepts and insights can be gleaned from these studies, including the presence of consistent whole classes of structures that are highly complex, multifaceted, and trans. On this basis, it is our hope that concepts and techniques glean from these studies will have the most impact over the field of catalytic reaction development.  Having observed peptide-based catalysts that are effective for our goals, we have undertaken their development for the process of catalyst discovery. It is also our desire to understand and anticipate future developments in this field so that they may improve the efficacy of the tools for catalysis in the understanding of complex molecular environments. Unfortunately, attempts to explore this avenue in catalyst discovery have not yielded the level of insight and insightfulness that may be readily offered by current methods. It is our hope that these explorations of the depths of catalyst design may prove fruitful.  Many research groups have examined the application of modern physical organic tools for the discovery of complex molecules. And, the field has grown and evolved in significant ways over the past 60 years. Along with novel ketone-substituted compounds, these early pioneers have established the viability of the field of physical organic synthesis. However, several fundamental concerns have been addressed since the beginning of the field. Specifically, the feasibility of chemical synthesis doing not seem to be wellestablished, and broad studies are often hampered by the need to manipulate complex natural products in the pursuit of new synthetic strategies.  In contrast, chemical synthesis is a field of growing. Indeed, a broad study of catalysis has been accomplished since the early 1970s. Seventeenth-century methods for chemical synthesis have been merged with a modern industrial synthesis strategy, and the resulting technologies have largely contributed to the modern synthesis of complex molecules.  As a result of this sustained interest in catalysis, significant effort has been directed toward the development of physically biased catalyst libraries that are highly optimized for catalysis. These focused libraries present important problems for the field of catalysis, including the integration of noncovalent interactions\n",

The organic layer was then dried, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to provide a deep yellow oil as a white foam.  The H 2 O was then evaporated in vacuo to remove excess MeOH. To the resulting crude material was then extracted with Et 2 O. The organic layer was then dried, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to provide a deep yellow oil as a white foam.  The H 2 O was then evaporated in vacuo to remove excess MeOH. To the resulting crude material was then extracted with Et 2 O. The organic layer was then dried, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to provide a deep yellow oil as a white foam.  Work-up and purification by the same method provided 9b as a white solid.   TLC: R f 0. 39, visualized with UV light.   Yield and diastereoselectivity were determined by NMR spectroscopy.   Reaction was performed by using only 0. 3 equiv of H 2 O.   Used 3. 0 equiv of DME.   Yield of isolated product.    Diastereoselectivities were determined by HPLC using a chiral stationary phase.   Performed on a 0. 5 mmol scale.   Used 3. 0 equiv of DMSO.   Using 2 mol catalyst.   Yield of isolated product.   Selectivities were determined by NC-MS as above.   An aliquot of the reaction mixture was collected at -40C, 5 min before a complete withdrawal of CO 2.   We then performed a CO 2 -extrusion, isolation, and immediate oxidation to give an off-white foam as a white powder.   We then performed three additional optimization of conditions using C-exchange of NaHCO 3 as the source of the CO 2. We found that optimal conditions involve the use of either NaHCO 3 or Ca 2 as the terminal oxidant and that Ca 2 is optimal for selectivity.  We then conducted a screen of solvent ingredients and conditions. Among those tested was 10, the source of selectivity was improved from 12. 5:1 to 14. 5:1 with a simple swap of one enantiomer of the dienophile with the other. We then determined that the reaction could be performed with a maximum of 20 mol catalyst loading without any dependence on the nature of the ester or the cationic nature of the amine.  We then performed a series of control experiments. When the reaction is performed in DMSO as the solvent, the selectivity is approximately equal in the absence of DMSO. If the reaction is performed in H 2 O, the reaction proceeds with near equal amounts of the two N-isomers, 5:1 and 4:1, in short order, obscuring the first N-iminium isomer to minimize brownout of the more unstable amine. In addition, the reaction is completely insensitive both to the carbon monoxide of the substrate and to the chlorine monoxide of the catalyst.  Since the ground state of the amine catalyst is effectively agnostic of both the N-and C-termini of the substrate, we chose to proceed with the N-is\n",

      " frame-mediated reaction of aldehydes at the 2-position of acylimines is a much more challenging objective, and also requires a much longer reaction time. In fact, examinations of the peptide-based catalysts for the addition of dimethylzinc to aloneoxide in the presence of watermark also leads to some evidence that this reaction is phosphine-mediated. However, if these effects are manifest in the removal of water, then the catalysts are possibly in competition with one another for a similar process, then the watermark may serve as a testing ground for the applications of our chemistry.  From a screen of 45 solvents, we identified that the use of 2-mebutyl-1-methyl-2-butenol gives the highest levels of enantioselectivity whilst maintaining reaction efficiency. This is consistent with our observations from previous studies. Experimentally, the reduction of the solubility of 1-methyl-2-butenol leads to 6-epoxide 13 in 48 solvents, whereas use of the proprietary methyl-silyl-propanol leads to a dramatic increase in the insolubility of the biphenyl compound. The dramatic change in solubility as a function of watermark also leads to some evidence that the reaction is indeed phosphine-mediated. Studies of the peptide-based phosphine-catalyzed addition of dimethylzinc to a-branched alcohols also lead to some interesting data. For example, if the reaction is performed in the presence of H 2 O 2, the 1-methyl derivative 14 is obtained as the major product, and monoepoxide 15 is formed in minor quantity. Given that the χ-based catalysts are defined by their secondary structure, we also examined a peptide catalyzed variant of the process employing the modified amino acid. Moreover, we found that the variant with the aspartic acid side chain gives a considerably less drastic attenuation of the er. To our knowledge, this study represents the first example of an atropisomerism of amino acids that is accompanied by substantial change in the side chain sterics.  We also examined a related, atropisomer-selective cyclodehydration to probe the effect of the imidazole-containing peptide structure on enantioselectivity. Use of pypidine as the nucleophile allows for a sequential, dynamic reaction of the p-chloride of carboxylic acids, allowing for a comprehensive panel of access to a single atropisomer. Remarkably, catalyst 22 exhibits high levels of enantiocontrol in the cyclodehydration, presumably due to the preference for aryl-aryl interactions with the catalyst backbone. Biased peptide 23 proves to be less effective as an catalyst in this reaction, delivering primarily the l-alkyl product.  We then decided to investigate the role of the Me-amido group. In order to do so, we generated biphenyl, dimeric atropisomers that are biased to behaviorally resemble the biphenyl, type I arylaryl compounds. The initial result was a phenomenon we would observe regularly as our studies of amido-containing peptides continued. As the nucleophile group remained constant, the reaction mixture evolved to incorporate multitudes of substituents, with neither the i-methyl nor i-alkyl substituents proving optimal.  However, when the response was to incorporate electron-withdrawing groups, we observed a dramatic increase in catalytic activity. Thus, we found that catalyst 22 outperformed any of the control catalysts we examined. Thus, we found that the results we had for the type I arylalkyl peptide were essentially the best possible results for a peptide-catalyzed reaction. Moreover, these reactions were consistently higher in conversion than the corresponding reactions containing either S-epoxide or Me-epoxide. To our knowledge, these reactions are the first examples of non-benzyl amido-containing peptides for the purpose of atroposelective synthesis of oxazolones.  A more detailed account of this peptidecatalyzed atroposelective cyclodehydration is presented in. Our studies began with an evaluation of the catalyst architecture and the role of the peptide within the overall asymmetric catalysis of the atroposelective cyclodehydration. As shown in, a set of peptides based on the general structure of peptide 15 was originally evaluated for their performance in the atroposelective cyclodehydration of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde using only imidazole as the catalyst. Remarkably, catalyst 22 showed not to be a good catalyst, providing only a modest k rel for the corresponding reaction; although the low k rel of catalyst 22 was modestly, due primarily to entropic effects. An additional peptide was found to be superior, providing a high k rel of 70 for the\n",

      "nit aldehyde a-methylene substrates that incorporate in situ tunable lengths of the a-allyl cation were found to be viable coupled partners for this redox-amine catalysis protocol. For example, 5-hex-2-hexanal underwent decatungstate oxidative coupling to generate the corresponding a-allyl aldehyde 7 in 86 yield, again with useful levels of enantiocontrol. Intriguingly, a-allyl aldehydes incorporating a nitroalkyl group were specifically resistant to this method, resulting in the highest yields of ee, resistance to racemization, and highest enantioselectivities of the possible crosubstrate assembly. Resistance to the racemization process via stoichiometric removal of the a-allyl moiety was also observed.  The potential application of this photoredox-alkylation protocol to medicinal chemistry has received considerable attention. In this context, both the promise and peril of using this activation mode for the movement of complex cysteine-based synthetic precursors through reaction mixtures have been well-examined. While these studies are now in their infancy, and while the scope of the reaction was determined to be limited to the most electrophilic polyol substrates, 7 this study first revealed the potential utility of photoredox catalysis in enabling late-stage synthetic engineering. As a second salient example, Yoon and co-workers disclosed a dual nickel photoredox protocol that used the radical cation DFT-2 7 to catalyze the decarboxylative coupling of benzylic ethers with styrenes. At this time, the drawback of the enzymatic catalysis model was the required ligand-size variation in the cross-coupling partner. The authors calculated that a large variety of mono-and bis-styrenes could be combined with isoprenol or styrene to form compounds with good yields using this dual catalysis platform. Indeed, the best results were obtained using octanal, although other substrates could also be coupled with varying intensities.  The usefulness of this dual catalysis strategy was further explored in the context of a total synthesis of propionyl chloride. As noted in the Introduction, hydrolysis of the a-allyl radical 7 or the enal 5 is possible to produce acid free alcohols 9. If the aldehyde R-fination step occurs as part of a synthesis of benzylic alcohols 10, then the required R-emission step occurs a second time at the a-allyl radical. At this time, both the a-allyl radical and the non-electron-deficient alkyl radical may be used to generate another equivalent of themselves. Alternatively, it may be possible to recognize the a-allyl radical as a result of reduction of the a-oxyaldehyde to the corresponding benzyl radical. This result is in complete accord with a radical pathway and not a cationic addition mechanism.  In the mechanistic study using the model compound 313, the author proposed that the -enamine radical undergoes addition to the olefin followed by 1-and 2-trifluoromethyl radical addition to the enal. It is possible that this radical adds to the olefin directly from the less hindered face of the radical cation, enabling reduction of the anvilide by the excited state Ir species. Alternatively, it is observed that the -emitting addition product 314 is formed as a mixture of carbazolium salt products.  If the aldehyde R-fination step occurs as part of a synthesis of propionaldehyde, then the required R-emission step would be rendered unnecessary via the hyperconjugative addition of a radical anion to the enal. As already demonstrated, the radical addition product 314 is formed as a mixture of two and three diastereomers.  If the aldehyde R-fination step is performed as part of a synthesis of benzylic alcohols, then a second equivalent of an aldehyde to an imine occurs. The aldehyde radical addition product 313 does not undergo racemization as a product of this oxidation process, but rather through a backdoor effect to form alcohol 313. Continuing to generate carbon-bonded aldehyde products 314, the author was able to transfer the +3-bonded state of the aldehyde to amines and nitrogen-based heterocycles such as pyrazine reagents.  Finally, the author was able to rapidly generate a diverse series of R-substituted aldehydes in situ via the use of the photocatalyst Ir 3 the photographexcited state of the product Ir III complex is 0. 77 [ its complementary red team partner. These experiments strongly indicate that the rate of the reaction of benzylic alcohols is faster than the rate of radical addition to aldehydes.  Significantly\n",

      " blocks, both of which contain a dialkylamide motif, and a 2, 3-dialkylamide scaffold. We then designed structural panels around these structural motifs using DFT calculations. We initially considered the simple case of a -turn motif, after consideration of the known nucleation of the amino acid. We chose to investigate constructions that exhibited both a basic amine and an N-terminal carboxylate, as shown in. Both of these peptides exhibited relative energies of 490 cm 1 and 370 cm 1, respectively, suggesting that a -turn is populated to a lesser extent in these structures. A greater-than-statistical chance of a -turn amine was observed, with a 94:6 er observed in the basic model. Importantly, basic structure calculations for the catalytic peptide 0. 52 were complemented by DFT computations, which showed that a 93:7 er is already present in the ground state of the peptide. We also found value in the type II -hairpin conformation of 3, delivering the hairpin H-bond the distance is 2. 810 and 2. 792.  We then turned our attention to the extension of these studies to other substrates and other classes of functionalized peptides that might be associated with peptides in a mechanistic manner. As such, we examined different solvent-related compounds of peptide 3 in a kinetic resolution. The results of these kinetic resolutions are shown in. Reactions were run at 0. 1 mmol scale and were quenched after 12 h by addition of MeOH, followed by warming the reaction mixture to room temperature. See Supporting Information for details.  The results of our alkylimidazole structural study are shown in. Reactions were run at 1. 0 mmol scale and were quenched by addition of MeOH, followed by warming the reaction mixture to 0. 1 mmol to afford 5 in 61 yield by NMM. Alkylimidazole was found to exhibit a High-order dependence on both peptide sequence and membrane face chemistry, with a cationic interaction between the C-terminal amide of the substrate and the NH of the i2i3 peptide. The observed solution phase jitter of 3 is consistent with the possibility of a symbionic interaction between this species and the catalyst, perhaps a hydrogen bond between NH and CO that is not possible with peptide 3 alone. The solution phase jitter of peptide 3 has also been proposed to be involved in the hydrogen bond between the i3 amide of the substrate and the NH of the i2i3 peptide. In these calculations, the i2i3 amide is projected to be trans to a hydrogen bond with the CO of the i2i3 peptide. In accord with the observed solution phase jitter, the C-terminal carboxylate of 3 was considered, but, (as with peptides 3 and 3a, the peptide sequence outlined inhas not been found to be involved in a hydrogen bond. More specifically, this peptide-trans interaction does not occur by accident, but as a result of a secondary structure whose centrality is compromised by the presence of a carboxylate, a peptide, or protein.  In an analogous experiment, Minakakis and co-workers have employed colorimetric CD-hybrid systems similar to those discussed in chapter 3 to assess the conservation of binding across multiple substrates and to evaluate the degree of trans selectivity in an area of essential role for asymmetric catalysis. The choice was fortuitous in two ways: first, we were able to observe firsthand the presence of some dipeptides that felt like proper peptides by HPLC and NMR methods second, but peptides that lacked i2 or i3 residues required a strategy to spot them on a screen. We employed a fluorogenic enolization probe. An IC 50 of 0. 25 M was determined for the kinetic resolution of planar-substituted and ortho-fluorinated nucleophiles. Of note, more electron-rich thanryl iodides yielded lower IC 50 values. In this case, we also noticed that the handling of a fluorogenic enolization probe by a different class of catalyst compared to peptide 3 only slightly eroded the enantioselectivity of the reaction away from the functional group.  Our interpretation of these results is that it may be possible to observe enantioselectivity of organocatalytic pathways that are not located within any peptide-defined secondary structure. The percentage of unsymmetrical bis is consistent with a hydrogen bond between the known and unknown residues of 3. In addition, it is possible that there are additional chemical events that lead to substrate, perhaps the resolution of specific interactions, or the loss of functionality altogether. Estease from the SOMO species is stained with fluorescence, and its fluorescence appears to be proportional to the amount of water and in some\n",

      " SI, a remarkable selectivity we have for peptide 6. 3d, a putative competitor for the ASX-turn-motif.  We thus proceeded with the evaluation of different peptide-based catalysts for the desymmetrization of meso-diols 6. 11. In order to gain insight into the elements that make these unique, we planned to identify structural features that would explain the selectivity observed in the bromination of quinazolinone 6. 11. When presented with the opportunity to develop a catalyst that would deliver product 6. 11 with high levels of enantioselectivity, we turned to peptide-based catalyst with a potential engine-like atmosphere, thus identifying a common core structure that could be applied across a diverse range of substrates. The structure of a peptidebased catalyst that possesses an amide-containing catalytic residue at the N-terminus was not surprising. In fact, examination of libraries of short peptide sequences containing the sequence Boc-Asp-Aib-Phe-OMe provided a number of interesting examples of asymmetric Bromination. The initial reaction that we had studied required alcohol -6. 11 to undergo the bromination of sulfone 6. 11 to give diene 6. 12. Alcohol -6. 11 is an excellent substrate class to test for enantioselectivity. We therefore prepared a number of alcohol -6. 11 derivative derivatives as a gauge to compare the influence of the alcohol substituents on the enantioselectivity. These derivatives were used as a screening tool to determine if the enantioselectivity of -6. 11 could be enhanced using a more reactive aldehyde catalyst. Reaction results from our investigations include the percentage of conversion to the product and the diastereomeric ratio of the major and minor diastereomer. The 100 conversion line is as described in. The top trace is the yield of product, and the percentage of conversion to the two diastereomers is shown in the first column of Table 1. The reactions were run to conversion and observed ejection from the resin at right of the figure. The middle trace is the diastereomeric ratio of the first reaction, while the fraction of conversion to the second reaction is shown in the second. The two reactions are shown inseparate in. The conversions were measured to determine the diastereomeric ratio of the product. The reactions were run to 70 conversion and added to a 5 mol scale with catalyst 5 to give -6. 12 within 10 min. Pd 2 3 was then added and the reaction continued for 6 h without further purification.  The results of the studies are summarized in. The results of the studies are divided into two steps: one step based on conjugate addition of the diaryliodonium catalyst to the enone and the subsequent chromatography of the enone using a Waters Acquity UPLC UPLC instrument. The conversion to the diaryliodonium salt and subsequent chromatography are shown in. The top trace is the yield of the reaction, and the percentage of conversion to the dibromide, while the bottom trace is the yield of the reaction based on incorporation of Zn and into the diaryliodonium salt. It is noted that significant component in the reaction conversion is on the S N 2 issue, which is amenable to solubility in nonpolar organic solvents. In the experiments using these conditions, the reaction did not proceed in toluene, but rather in aqueous solution of methanol and water. The reaction conversion was found to be highly dependent on the temperature, and with the example of, the positive pressure forced the reaction to proceed at a higher temperature than the negative pressure of the isomer without interconversion. exposes the surface of the SOMO species and the structure of 6. 14. Most of the visible light that enters the Ir III catalyst is on the carbon to the right of the D-Pro amide, leaving the D-Pro and Glu residue open to the outside surface. In contrast, the insensitivity of this system to organic polymer materials has been well documented. As such, we envision that the use of a more reactive aldehyde or a more degressive metal such as TES preferentially delivers 6. 14. This is in agreement with our previous observations. Additionally, the effigy of 6. 14 could therefore be promoted by hydroxylative techniques or the incorporation of a suitable metal such as TBS.  We next evaluated the performance of catalyst 5 on OO-functionalized vancomycin derivatives 6. 16 and 6. 18. As shown in, these derivatives were examined under standard conditions of incubation with 100 mM Trmovice and 10 mol of peptide catalyst 5. The two major classes of compounds were evaluated, those predisposed to hydrolysis and those oriented toward proteolytic enzymes with aryl stabilization functions. Trends\n",

      "Dalcations. Following reaction of 25 for 10 min, HPLC and LCMS analysis revealed 86 remaining starting material along with minor mono-glucosyl product peaks, further supporting Tyr as the site of glycosylation.  Next, we assessed the generality of the aqueous Tyr-Oglycosylation reaction with additional biologically active peptides that each carried a single Tyr residue. Endomorphin-2, a highly selective agonist for the -opioid receptor, was glycosylated to generate 26 in 84 HPLC yield. The crude reaction mixture once again revealed the presence of some bis-glycosylated material, but this side product could be removed such that a sample of mono-glycosylated endomorphin-2 could be characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, endomorphin-1, when subjected to the same reaction conditions, delivered 27 with near quantitative conversion. In this case, however, the isolated material revealed the presence of a second species, which could not be removed. Although racemization was not observed in the control experiments described above, it cannot not be excluded in this case. Because the only difference between endomorphin-2 and endomorphin-1, it is perhaps unsurprising that there is a small amount of unolefinated material along with the major polyol component. Although the molecular structure does not exhibit precision like that of the -hairpin, the unit cell does display a type I -turn by 2 out of four carbons in the center of the sphere. We and others have found that, in a wide variety of solvents, the phenyl phosphate is optimally glycosylated to form the Ca 2 -dependent glycosyl ester 27. Notably, any other Solvents Inters allow for efficient generation of the desired glycosyl ester. Early studies using short peptides or di-and tripeptides as catalysts revealed that the heads-to-tail, pair-tosyl-acid linkage, which is the central Hsp90 intermediate in the development of a -turn, is critical for coordinating the peptide and the ferrocenium. The importance of the -turn and the coordination of the ferrocenium are key to the success of the glycosylation reaction.  The glycosylation of various R, unsaturated ketones remains an important objective with respect to the synthetic and medicinal chemistry goals of the field of total synthesis. While catalytic methods for the formation of various glycosyl esters exist, those that afford molarly large quantities of aqueous hydrogen oxalate are rare. As part of a programme aimed at developing broadly useful organic catalysts for enantioselective synthesis, we recently reported the metallaphotoredox-catalyzed coupling of allenoate with maloniazonium salts. In this communication we advance this research to describe a highly enantioselective procedure for the R, unsaturated ketone modification. To our knowledge, this study represents the first example of an intermolecular R-chlorination that can be accomplished with high levels of enantiocontrol.  The effect of catalyst loading on reaction efficiency was next evaluated. Remarkably, catalyst loadings as low as 0. 5 m can be utilized without substantial loss in efficiency. Considerable reduction in the reaction yield is observed when 1-4 M catalyst is used, providing 80 efficiency without loss in the observed er. Importantly, all of the reactions described herein were performed under aerobic atmosphere with wet solvents using an inexpensive, commercial, bench stable amine catalyst.  In addition to the scope of the reaction in terms of the natural product, this study revealed that complex poly hydrocarbon substrates are also amenable to this enantioselective procedure. For example, the reaction can tolerate -o-coloured benzene and phenyl-substituted benzene, as well as '-chloro- and chloro-substituted benzene. '-Heterocyclic conjugents have also been coupled to serve as suitable substrates. The addition of the (e frothing the amine catalyst is required for the reaction to proceed, presumably to facilitate the production of the targeted R-amino acid.  With regard to the scope of the reaction in general, we have found that it is tolerant to a range of N-Boc-substituted substrates. For example, pyrrolidine has been found to undergo the reaction without a decrease in reaction efficiency with modification of the Boc-protecting group. Conversely, 2-chloro-substituted pyrrolidine was found to be amenable to the same reaction, while the 1-naphthyl-substituted derivatives Mildly or moderately modified do not afford the expected R-amino acid 4 due to the amine 10 reduction.

Kinetic Resolutions of Peptide-Accelerated Chaliphatic Phosphorylation in Tandem With Peptide-PLC Enzymes a a a Chakshalypse at K14 and Aib at K56 were coupled by PLC using a cassandra-methodextrin system on behalf of IPQC. The resulting recombinant protein was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min in a sealed tube. After stirring for all allocated reaction time, the reaction was taken out of the ice bath. Phosphorylation of theadyne was monitored by CD intensity in PLCNMe 2 solution.  where I is integration at evolution period t, T 1 is the spinlattice relaxation time, and A is a constant.  Computational Studies of the Peptide-Accelerated Dominant Structural Characteristic of the Crystallographic Sample. The solution structure of the I Na ion was analyzed by computational studies using the program CNS. The on-beada-modified peptide i was found to be stable in the solid state. Additionally, the solution structure of the corresponding tMg ion is shown in. The majority of the structural features of 1a are retained in the solid state structure, including the central tyrocyan oxygen and the C64Phe ion. The only exception is the backbone dihedral angles, which deviate substantially from the canonical values and are significantly wider than that of 1a. These deviations result from conformational aggregation of the single amino acids, which has shown tremendous influence on the spatial attributes of peptides. Furthermore, the angle sampling for the enantioselective phosphorylation of 1a is significantly wider than that of 1a.  In light of the foregoing computational studies, we can propose a explanation of the apparent substrate-controlled site selectivity observed for this phosphorylation reaction. The i 3 residue is oriented such that the sodium and potassium groups are orthogonally aligned, and the long-and short-range NOE correlations display a highly organized, co-and untethered nature. The hydrophobic interactions between the peptide i3 Gly and the amide NH groups are absent, in keeping with a decrease in the solubility of the substrate. More specifically, the hydrophobic interactions between the PhMe of the i3 Gly and the DAla DAla of 1a are reconstructed by the NOESY spectra of 3 and 3 in a coupled way. Moreover, this hypothesis is supported by the so-called co-homologous endo dihedrals, which deviate from the canonical values but are still within the amide product. More specifically, the calculated and dihedrals are found to be compatible with a wide range of structural types. Moreover, the steric demand of the i3 Gly material is accommodated by the steroid ring system. It is fitting, then, that the excellent enantioselectivity is retained aliphatic glucosamine selectivity when using 2 of 12 peptide 2g, a derivative that is unambiguously a pre-helical, type I structure and which has been studied extensively.  It is interesting to note that, while speculative, s ome thoughtsa bout this series included the possibility of an alternative, antagonistic iodine effect where the side chain would be significantly more reactive than the CH bond of the main chain. It was also possible that the Os-OH group of 3 could act as a proper replacement for the Asp-OH group, with H-Asp being optimized for noncatalytic SI reductive elimination, thus leading to the desired diastereochemical equilibrium.  Finally, f ilter, w ed eveloped simulations using the NCIOM package, which enables post-quantitative analysis of the effects of many of the peptides. The use of r ombinatorial formulas as the guiding force for design is particularly powerful. This is especially true in the realm of the peptide designer. T he novel amphiphiles employed in the present study have been employed previously in the automotive industry, and these practices have seen wide usage. Perhaps the most widely utilized application of the amphiphiles is the production of N-acyl hydrazines, which are powerful electrophiles due to their ability to induce homodimerization on aromatic and homobenzylic carbonyls. Very recently, the strategy of Site-Selective Alcohol-Water Hybrid has been developed by Brnsted and co-workers for the de novo nucleophiles of squalene which are massive carriers of chlorine, sulfonium, and other bulky aromatic nucleophiles.

      " technological 1g and P14. Given the magnitude of the effect, P19 was found to be the more selective catalyst, providing 5:1d in 48 h at 25C. Higher rates of racemization under more mild conditions were obtained under the initial reaction conditions. Neopentyl sulfamate, the isolated arginine product, should be distinguished from a monomer into a dimer complex that is axially chiral about the central substituent of the -issociation product. In fact, the observed enantioselectivity is not observed with less than 4 equiv of N-methyl n-pyrrolidinium further suggesting that the P19 selective catalyst, P2, is the more active one. Several additional studies were performed to appraise the relevance of kinetic studies for stereoselective desymmetrization catalysts. It was found that the rate of P19 formation was approximately first order in the absence of catalyst, and that the product distribution was dependent on the identity of the -turn element of the peptide. For example, in the absence of a -turn residue, 5:1d was observed, but under the control of TUR, the enantioselectivity was eroded. It was proposed that this may be due to the flexibility of the cycloheptane core, which could also activate 21 toward S E Ar. However, when a -turn residue was substituted for an -amino acid, the reaction rates were capped, leading to a further erosion in enantioselectivity. A high-murder chiral GC The compound of interest 4, 4-difluoroglutamic acid derivative was isolated from the reaction of P19 with THF. It was found that the flame-dried 100 mL round-bottom flask was able to accommodate the chloromethyl solids of multiple catalysts on the same reaction reagent. These crystals were then purified by column chromatography to afford the crystalline scaffold of D-I-3, 5, 6P 4.  Furthermore, it was observed that the P19 catalyzed reaction deposited only trans-stenophilic residues with the C-terminus of the substrate, whereas the P32 catalyzed reaction, which is biased to favor the axial C-H bond, gave l-I-3, 5, 6P 4.  The reports from the laboratories of P32 and P19 displayed a strong correlation between structure and catalyst activity. Therefore, the crystals from the S2 archive were crystallized with both D-and L-Ala-Trp-OMe as the catalyst. The advantage of the two catalysts is that D-I-3, 5, 6P4 and D-I-3, 5, 6P2 exist as closely related mixtures of the C-terminus residues. The observation that both D-I-3, 5, 6P4 and D-I-3, 5, 6P2 exist in the same conformation with the same set of properties is intriguing. This appears to be true for Con-and D-I-1A as well as L-and L-Asn-OMe. The challenge of the C-terminus of D-I-3, 5, 6P4 is solved by the alanine monomer, which is quite close to covalent catalysis.  The challenge of asymmetric catalysis, in terms of both reactivity and selectivity, is often manifested in drug discovery projects, and also in the synthesis of the natural product. Therefore, the synthesis of alternative monomers, such as L-Asn and L-Leu, may be possible chemoselectively through the action of catalyst 1. As in the case of the nitroesters, an enantioselective catalyst can be identified that provides an asymmetric array for the creation of either L-Asn or L-Leu.  This structure has been studied in many contexts and, importantly, has led to a number of biologically active compounds. Therienzman, R. , Jr. , and co-workers have pursued the total synthesis of D-I-3, 5, 6P4 on the basis of materials provided by the authors. The synthesis was thereafter redirected to D-I-3, 5, 6P3.  In 2007, Jrgensen and co-workers further investigated the concept of merging photoredox and transition metal catalysis, and a dual photoredox palladium catalyst system was designed that enabled C-H arylation of 2-arylpyridines with aryl diazonium salts. Prior to this report, palladium-catalysed C-H arylation protocols typically required the presence of strong oxidants andor elevated temperatures. By merging photoredox and palladium catalysis, the outlined C-H arylation could be conducted at ambient temperature and in the absence of strong external oxidants, thereby providing simpler reaction times\n",

      " tr for the most part. A small number of peptides that provide highly selective for the 6, 7-position are known to adopt -type turns that are significantly different from the canonical turns. More recently, it has been reported that a -turn-biased H-bond may be present in the solid state. The effects of this structure on enantioselectivity are now under study. In particular, the reaction is conceivable that a -turn may form in situ, which would violate the backbone symmetry. Despite these facts, we have not yet observed a catalytic mechanism that can explain the true function of these -turn-containing tetrapeptides.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In terms of a catalyst scaffold, we examined simple derivatives of Taz in order to establish whether or not the single residue would provide a catalytically active substructure. To our surprise, simple derivatives of the single amino acid proved to afford appreciable selectivity in the cyclization. When catalyst 4a was employed under optimized conditions, a modest selectivity of 42 ee was observed in the product, which was isolated in low yield. Of note, when the urethane nitrogen was alkylated as in catalyst 4b, the enantioselectivity was completely eroded. The nature of the nitrogen protecting group was also found to have a substantial effect on selectivity. For example, exchange of BOC for acetyl resulted in an increase in both yield and selectivity. Examination of tosyl amides also provided an improvement with catalyst 4d delivering 70 ee at low conversion. The l-isyl amide group provides superior enantiocontrol resulting in 92 ee at low conversion. The results also demonstrate that two different classes of catalysts can be successfully employed to isolate specific benefits from the various functional groups listed.  The results of these studies are particularly intriguing in light of the number of known functional groups that appear to be resistant to oxidation. As noted above, various ketones are known to be poor substrates for classical thermal methods, which requires a very rapid in situ electron oxidation to establish the key oxidative addition step. Moreover, ketones that are intrinsically stable toward oxidation are suitable substrates for the Stetter family of catalysts.  Given the analogy, we also evaluated plain old tetrapeptide catalysts in a bifunctional capacity. Thus, we began with catalyst 4 as a benchmark to be used for screening this study.  Catalyst 4 Evaluation with naphthyl-N-acetyl-N-phenylacetamide. Title compound was prepared from naphthyl-N-acetyl-phenylacetamide according to the procedure outlined in the Supporting Information.  Studies of the stereoselective reduction of amino acid derivatives to the corresponding amino acid derivatives in the presence of the trifluoromethyl groups began with the examination of simple derivatives of Titisen alkal, in which the lacman-like transition state was represented. We were interested in determining whether or not the simple derivatives of dalkindole would participate in the desired reduction. To our surprise, simple derivatives of the alkaloid were ineffective at preventing the dimerization of DeS. Moreover, all attempts to access the dimerization product using either chloro or halogen had thus far failed. On the other hand, introduction of acetyl groups in the meta-position of the phenyl rings provided moderate yields of the desired dimer, which was isolated in good yield for 7a and 8a.  The production of additional stereoisomers of 8a was accomplished in good yield for catalyst 4d. Treatment of 8a with TMSN 3, t-BuCO 2, and Et 3 N in presence of catalytic CuI 3 provided the desired tetrapeptide in 70 yield. The reaction medium was also critically involved in the reaction since it was found that the reaction rate of the trialkyl group was significantly decreased in the presence of chloro or halogen monomers. Following the reaction, to assay the legitimacy of the observed enantiomeric ratios, we examined if the ratios were influenced by the size of the catalyst. Thus, three different sets of catalyst-size dalkindole catalysts were synthesized to explore the stereochemical relationships within.  Both before-and after- syntheses were examined using peptide 4d with the exception of the sterically hindered tert-butyl group, which was used to produce 8a. Initially, the catalysts were examined in syn solution, and the desired selectivity was only modest. When dipeptide 4d was used to investigate enantioselectivity, it made a notable difference between the syn and anti protocols. As shown in, the anti-selective reaction was greatly improved in yield. It is possible that the increased selectivity observed for the anti-selective reaction in the SYN system compared to the syn system suggests that the tert\n",
