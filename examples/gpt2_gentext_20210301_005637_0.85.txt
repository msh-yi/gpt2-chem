The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Perhaps the most often, this approach leads to catalysts or catalyst families that are effective for a range of asymmetric reactions. Within the realm of drug design, the stereospecific incorporation of polyfluorinated alkenes is an elegant and highly effective strategy for rapid access to hydrofluorinated counterparts. Catalysts provide affordable access to enantioenriched R-CF 3 derivatives, which are important intermediates en route to drug-like molecules. In particular, a catalyst derived from the combination of a catalyst and a substrate allows for the specific incorporation of CF 3 groups on arenes. Such catalysts have proven to be of great value in the past for the asymmetric R-trifluoromethylation of aryl bromides, a reaction employed in the rapid synthesis of high impact drugs. In contrast, a catalytic system based on a single amino acid requires a well-precedented event to achieve the desired product, a well-precedented fact that is, until now, the purview of highly educated catalyst families.  The effect of catalyst structure on enantioselectivity is intriguing
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of a given reaction coordinate. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one primary and three secondary structures and cascade catalysis with one primary and two secondary structures.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single catalytic center. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, again using a carboxylic acid-based phosphine catalyst. More recently, Shibasaki and coworkers have developed a highly stereoselective three-component coupling reaction using the lanthanide-BINAP catalyst system, again using a carboxylic acid-NMI as the noncovalent structure. Although the component is designed as a single diastereomer, the high selectivity of an IC 50 of 0. 67 M can be obtained for phenyl ester 2. The high ers obtained for the synthesis of 5 and 6 suggest
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the simple functional group within a molecule that bears no functional group defined in the molecule. Peptide synthesis is an interesting class of molecules, as a kernel in the tail between the catalytic imidazole moiety and the central Asn residue. The fundamental approach of peptide synthesis is the catalytic production of new peptides. On this basis, we recently questioned whether a simple, nonactivated elemental amino acid might be a suitable substrate for the DESY-type chromatographyalay. The synthesis of a new peptide from the scratch is a Fo-Pmh-DPro-Aib-DTrp-DPhe-OMe, as illustrated in Scheme 1.  We thus prepared the dimeric peptide catalyst 4, and employing the standard procedure outlined in the Supporting Information. Standard Wittig olefination was followed by simultaneous allylation of the a-alkyl groups and compound B. The resulting crude material was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide the desired product as a white solid. 1 H NMR 7. 35, 7. 27 8. 1 Hz, 4H, 4. 95, 4. 50, 4. 44, 4. 95, 4. 50, 4
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is represented by its axial C-H bond. The central issue in this prior study was that small peptides that possess axial C-H bonds may enable enantioselective reductions of enals with H 2 O 2. The reaction we undertook to develop was designed as a variant of the classic Debauketin an the photo N-acylimidazole from -fatty acid and acid chlorides. Our strategy was that we would pools of unpurified myo-inositol-1-phosphate and and in the absence of peptide catalyst 1. Our goal was to extract all of the pyrrolidine rings of 1 and the free N-phthalimide, which can be fragmented for sequencing by conventional methods. We initiated a screening study of bis- 3-hydroxy-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate as a function of the intramolecular H-D of the peptide catalyst. Of course, we were keenly aware of the possibility of overfunctionalization to give bis 25, which bears the ketone monomer at the i 2 position. However, we also envisioned that the peptide secondary structure could be sufficiently diverse to allow for
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of reactions performed on racemic substrates. Given the Apostle-Pablo-Scheffer epimerization at the stereogenic center of the catalyst, we wondered whether it might be possible to significantly boost the catalytic activity of our conjugate addition strategy. In this regard, we were inspired by the function of our recently developed integrated photoreactor, which features a jet-jet interface but is unable to itself perform conjugate addition because of the flying symptoms of two-photon absorption which are exacerbated by the inclusion of a gel. We thus wondered whether it might be possible to integrate a tertiary-amyl radical-filled site into a peptide and thereby enable the enantioselective conjugate addition.  Some keys on our strategy appear to include a. Agitation of the Agonyl To Produce iminium ion 4. The United States federal government has recognized that promoting the production of enantiomeric materials is of high priority and has been empowered by the dual-catalysis of enolates and enones pioneered by the Samueli-Martin group. The United States Forest Service has taken significant steps in the area of land use and interaction with the

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst–dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then obtained a set of catalysts based on the combination of a rhodium catalyst to give 16. Interesting to note, the product distribution delivered under the control of peptide 1 was roughly equivalent to the product of a single enantiomer, while the other 19 became more evenly split between the two possible stereoisomers. The result was a dramatic increase in the er to 93:7. We then examined a screen of the choice of. Size-Based N-Dependent Reactions of Oxidic Warehouse Fir DurvediSalami AcetylidinoScope a, b a Reaction conditions: substrate, diethyl bromide, Cs 2 CO 3, DMFTol, or DMF. also showed that there was an increase in selectivity as the concentration of silyl bromide increased. On the other hand, upon treatment of noseblegued epoxyketone 16 with silyl iodide, a reversal of inherent selectivity was observed. In this case, the Cs 2 CO 3 provided the major adduct, while the use of the DMF protocol provided the minor
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if it might be possible to develop catalysts that would reverse the intrinsic reactivity patterns observed with mixtures of either by virtue of either catalysts or the ability to develop catalysts that deliver alternative isomers selectively, is there a limit to the degree of enantiocontrol that may be achieved with catalysts That ranges from modest to high, it is a significant challenge to develop catalysts that produce highly functionalized scaffolds containing multiple catalytic functionalities. Thus, our initial experiments sought to define a catalyst that would reverse the inherent, highly mobile functions of the-C-H bonds.  As shown in, we failed to achieve the goal of site-selective cross-coupling. However, using a Pmh-embedded peptide catalyst, we were able to capture several of the desired monocoupled products in the reaction mixture. When a larger quantity was desired, a Pmh-catalyzed cross-coupling protocol was developed. Under the optimized conditions, peptide catalyst Pmh-D-Pro-Aib-Phe-OMe afforded the product
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is a catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Further contributing to this challenge is the myriad of accessible conformations that such catalysts may populate, essentially all of which may be catalytically competent. Although it is fair to say that there are no direct structural studies of all currently known catalysts with conformer-dependent sequence spaces, there are large collections of structure-indetermining sequences that have been preferentially functionalized in recent years. In part, this sense of sheer quantityality with respect to catalyst structure is a consequence of the paucity of generalizable catalysts in quinazolinone or other saturated aldehyde substrates that have been employed in enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions.  Indeed, the ee value of our recent study of the kinetic resolution of methyl vinyl ketone-1, 4-dihydro-2-carboxylic acid is, on average, 65 ee. As shown in, the lowest-energy conformer of this (Type II -turn is 80 ee, while the other variants are closer to the artificial 168 ee.  There are at least three other possibilities that one can
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is likened to consist of a family of fundamental reactions. However, few bits of information about the synthesis of the ordered peptides seem to be abundant. The above results, taken together, reveal the complexity of this sensitive blood-and gene-targeted process.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylsilyl acetate as a byproduct. 8 Introduction of the R, -unsaturated ketone in the presence of an amine catalyst could then lead to conjugate addition. Indeed, treatment of cyclohexenone with 5 equiv of TMSN 3 and AcOH in the presence of catalytic quantities of Et 3 N for 20 h resulted in clean conversion to azidoketone 2 in 90 isolated yield. A survey
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the molecule iminium ion, or iminium ion. The rest of the molecule is chiral because it contains a ruthenium. As noted above, the ruthenium catalyst induces a conformational change in the middle of the molecule that is bet binolite, causing strain in the binol bond. The strain in the binol bond is relieved by the presence of chiral alcohol, which alkylates the ruthenium. The resulting byproducts are those resulting from halogen atom abstraction from the chiral alcohol, which is heavy isotopically bound to the alcohol and cannot be nicely structuralized using classic normal-phase high-valent copper catalysis.  H-DADECS and H-DIMESY experiments were carried out to examine the direct and relative stereocenters of product 6a. Standard CD spectroscopy revealed a ratio of 13 to 1 of 49:37, which is most reliable toward exogenous calls for service in the synthesis of highly stereoporous compounds like 6b. The ratio was significantly improved to 1:1 with a slight increase in selectivity for the product of convenience.  To further understand the role of the distal degradative fixing group
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is saccharide, but the question is raised as to whether the structure of a molecule can be faithfully predictive of its subsequent actions. The answer is yes, it plays a significant role in executive functions of peptides. Each catalytic cycle starts from a known set of possible catalysts, and each optimally preserves the observed enantioselectivity. The question is, Why does the use of i2 continue to improve catalysts For this question we answer is elusive at this time.  It is useful to consider the experience of the Hitchens group in their studies of the intramolecular Hitchens reaction. On the one hand, they observed that the use of a p-methoxy-substituted alcohol effect negative selectivity, but that it was mitigated by lowering the reaction temperature. On the other hand, they observed that a 2-methyl-2-phenyl alcohol produces a similar result, while a 2, 3-dimethyl-2-phenyl alcohol is completely nonselective.  The observation of near total conformational homology between 2-methyl-2-phenylboronic acid and the free acid moiety in peptides 1 is intriguing. This observation is one that will require additional study
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is often referred to as a pesticide because of its potential to eradicate infectious A. baumannii. This class of compounds could presumably be synthesized on the basis of a catalyst-controlled pharmacodynamic niche. By analogy to the medicinal chemistry of NADH, which purportedly organizes H 2 O 2 to generate H 2 O 2, we anticipated that this channel might be exploited to generate aliphatic NADH compounds.  It is well precedented that the addition of ketones to aliphatic sodium complexes often occurs as part of a catalyst-controlled intramolecular aldol transition state. 20 A similar fate is accursed to catalysis of the intramolecular aldol reaction. Thus, application of the aliphatic NADH platform to natural product synthesis would be a natural product synthesis in a single operation.  The synthesis of the aliphatic NADH is believed to proceed as follows. Isolates from this family of natural products include citrinalins A and Band 2 and cyclopiamines A and B, which are the focus of this Article. The modifications of the indole core in the prenylated indole family, which occur by a reaction with dimethylallyl pyrophosphine
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could offer a handle for the multifunctional activation of stereochemically distinct sites within the same substrate. If the reverse were reversible, a library of different peptide catalysts could be obtained. Each peptide could then be subjected to a site-selective P-functionalization reaction targeting the functionalization of subchiral chemical sites within the corresponding molecules. If the selective catalysis could be achieved, a library of enriched catalysts could be obtained. Voting on the functionalization of specific sites within the molecular scaffold, either by simulating the ground state of the reacting peptide, or by focusing on an activated site and contrasting it with a much less active site, could lead to a number of interesting observations. And, of course, the uncontrolled formation of new compounds is a paramount challenge.  While a number of approaches have been taken to address the inelmarketing problem, two critical challenges that remain for this field are the limited availability of catalysts for remote desymmetrization of enantiotopic molecules, and the need to overcome the kinetically unique nature of the

The holy grail of catalysis is l, which is central to the meaning of catalysis. The field of ligand design is similarly young, but is guided by a well-known set of requirements. The promiscuousness of primordial chemistry is well-documented and a number of prominent scholars have contributed significantly to the effort. For practitioners of asymmetric catalysis, the necessity of white gold is sensibly related to the success of the field of Éner Bornem at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign. Her invention was reported in 2009 and publicized by the media. In contrast, our field of ligand design has suffered from the lack of diversity at the other end of a two-cell prism. Catalysts of varying steric and electronic nature have been applied to the problem, but the results are generally modest. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one archetype and one class of known, highly competent catalysts, and cascade catalysis with one more complex class of known, highly competent catalysts.  Studies on the Parallel Engagement of Vancomycin and Teicoplanin A 2 -2. Vancomycinhas been employed as a privileged catalyst for

The holy grail of catalysis is cleaved with a mixture of the boronic acid and acetic acid, which are moieties of the catalytic cycle. Acetine and carboxylic acid may be introduced into the reaction mixture at different rates, and each chirality may interconvert at different rates. The interconversion of enantiomers under the same conditions may be highly reversible, as demonstrated by the well-known Fischer alaninexend.  Long-Term Confidence in Catalysts and Stereochemistry. To assess the possibility of Catalyst Control, we rewarded entry into a monodebenzylated peptide catalyst that had been produced and characterized in our earlier studies. The peptide, an octapeptide, was now characterized as a -turn with a D-Pro 6. The record of the pre-organization of the i1 Pro image and the i2 Asn suggests that both are involved in the organization of the transition state. The N-terminal NH of the i2 Asn can interact with the peptide backbone, while that of the i3 Leu can't. The NMR spectrum of the peptide shows four well-defined turn structures, which are characterized by an S-Pro
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is established and embodies the embodiment of many functional groups, including multiple enzymes and multiple cell lines. Catalysts are wellsuited to address problems in the tailoring of high complexity natural products. Yet, the field of catalyst development has a number of challenges, including the theme of infinity-level detail that cannot be compartmentalized into nicetyllithium compounds. We attuned to these issues as we pursued the development of novel, operationally convenient, and highly enantioselective methods for the construction of olefins.  Our goal in catalyst design was to develop a catalyst that would be effective for the desymmetrization of a pentol, which bears a pendent diol. We chose to explore tetraalkylphosphine given its prominence in the literature. Our initial studies attempted to capitalize on the demonstrated ability of the pThr peptide-based catalysts to influence selectivities in the asymmetric conjugate addition of carbamate nucleophiles to nitroolefins. Taxol, a compound whose CMC is greater than 150 mM, was alone readily isolated as a single diastereomer in 48 yield. Even when the reaction was conducted with damping effects from the main chain
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, patterns of up to 71:29 er can be observed, when cis-2-pyridine is used as the catalyst. The er is greatly reduced when trans-2-pyridine is used, and the selectivity is preserved. Unabridged ROESY–survey of the i2 and i3 positions reveals that both are equally effective as catalysts. Significantly, incorporation of a D-Phe-Lys side chain in the i2 position leads to catalysis that proceeds in an tunable manner depending on the cyclic nature of the h 2 complex. Thus, because all of the data inrevealed that the optimal catalyst in the world, hexose, is hexose, we hypothesized that the selective reaction might be conducted in a enantiomeric format. The solution structure of a complex of d-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate and of 3-dicyanoimide is determined in a monomeric ratio, and the qualitative correlation between the observed enantioselectivity and the steric size of the catalyst is embodied in the
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst sequels that comprise six-to eight-membered ring H-bonds, the strength of which is reflected in the 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift and the one-bead fluorescence resonance. In that regard, we wondered if it might be possible to develop a set of two-step protectiondeprotection procedures that would enable the highly enantioselective synthesis of f, g-and d-fluorinated nucleic acids from the corresponding a, b-difluorides.  While we were excited by the prospect of developing aerosolite-and other widely used enzymes that might mediate the a-fluorination of a-allenic esters, we were simultaneously confronting the fact that the widely used ketone-based reactivity toward aldehydes did not provide nearly the same levels of diastereocontrol that the analogous ester-based reactions afforded. On the other hand, introduction of alkyl alcohols into the reaction mixture gave rise to a significant gain in diastereocontrol. The use of less electron-rich alcohols did not jeopardize the enantioselectivity, although the corresponding sterically hindered alcohol proved to be a formidable competitor
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst. Self-appointed catalysts have been discovered that mediate various bond-forming processes with remarkable levels of stereoselectivity. The interesting thing about these oxidations is the level of enantioselectivity they exhibit. For example, catalyst A A was found to effect the kinetic resolution of racemic trans-2-pyrrolidin to produce the enantiomeric product -2-yrrolidin, while catalyst B A was found to preferentially form the product, independent of any racemization.  The thing that surprises people is the level of asymmetric induction that can be achieved with chiral substrates. For example, people often find that the catalyst will usually favour the formation of a hemiaftitched product, which is asymmetric because the pyrrolidine ring is tetrahedral. However, if the two hemiaftitched products were to interconvert, as shown with achiral alcohol substrates, the catalyst would be more likely to form a hemiropitched product than to append a tetraalkyl.  People often ask whether a Hemi-Pro could be replaced with a hydroxyl-bearing alkyl-Me. This could alter the binding
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst Monobromide Complexity. Here we describe the results of an initial study of the hypothesis based on the observation of molecule evolution. Letting the i3 and i4 residues of the dual catalyst tripeptide Elatiphenylchloroformata Complex meet the minimal requirements for catalysis. They do not appear to be involved in catalyst-substrate binding and, more importantly, cannot participate in an enantioselective monobromination. Letting the i3 residue alone in the structure allows us to observe the influence of the N-terminal functional group. The dimethylamide side chain on the i2 and i3 positions provides some additional structural rigidity. Moreover, the nebulous boundary between the i2 and i3 residues may be a source of symmetry. Letting the whole structure be equal to this, we observed a range of behavior, including a nearly equimolar mixture of conformers.  On the other hand, the major product in the formation of 1 is the dimethylamide, and as shown in, the major diastereomer is epimeric to the type IIII of the i2 carbamate. The nanomolar ratio of 1 and ent-

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Pro as a catalyst, m-CPBA delivers an essentially 1:1 ratio of products m and l, which are then converted to 2:1:1 or further divided between l and m. There is a modest enhancement of the intrinsic product distribution, which is preserved by the addition of i3. The m-CPBA results in a dramatic acceleration in the l, l-14 and m-10 chemical shifts, which is nearly a FULL:1 ratio in favor of the m-CPBA product. ON the other hand, when peptide 10 is used as a catalyst, a nearly 1:1 ratio of m-CPBA and the o, o-9 and m-10 are observed. The nuclear Overhauser effect, an artifact of lattice-related crystallization, was also observed.  To determine whether the purportedly spiro transition states were operative in the reaction, we explored the peptide minimization strategy.
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, m-CPBA delivered the product in just 13 ee at 25:1 conversion, suggesting that the m-CPBA-favored product B is, at least, modestly stereospecific. On the other hand, m-CPBA delivered the product in 17 ee at the time scale we wished to observe. The fact that the m-CPBA-favored product B is indeed stereospecific is Engineering the Next Millennium: Catalysts and Reagents Development. After examining the m-CPBA-favored product B, we decided to investigate whether other nucleophilic amino acids that are not primed for one secondary alcohol referent were competent at this position. As shown in, Boc-Asp-Pro-Asp-Ala-OH afforded identical results to m-CPBA. However, Boc-Asp-Pro-Asp-Ala
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is rarely found in drug development programmes, as treatment of drug precursor is often required for the presence of functional groups that are not conducive to enamine catalysis. In contrast, the catalytic synthesis of enantiomerically enriched ketones is more readily accomplished through the incorporation of functional groups that are capable of forming enamine-allyl cations. In this context, our lab recently reported the direct a-allylation of secondary aliphatic alcohols through the use of optically enriched -keto esters. This strategy requires that the �enamine be stabilized via a suitable system of steric and electronic strain. Our lab has recently developed a videocatalytic system that enables the direct a-allylation of alcohols under mild conditions. The current version of this work involves the merger of photoredox catalysis with electrophilic alkyne- or carbonyl catalysis, and we hope this review has highlighted that the transition can be made.  The ability of amines to catalyze enantioselective cross-couplings between Rd-based enones 9. 11 was examined in the context of a-allylation of a-halo ketones 9. 12 with a variety of amine cataly
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is expressed within the realm of natural product synthesis.  A central tenet of this study was to develop new methodologies to manipulate the scaffold of vancomycin. Specifically, we hoped to demonstrate that there was a latent inner-sphere of significant reactivity in the structure of vancomycin under the conditions we wished to study. Given the substantial activity that had been observed, we expected this depleted inner-sphere produced via high-yielding functionalization of the phenols on the outer paste. We devised symmetrical dibenzylamine and treated it with a solution of dechlorovancomycin. The result was a highly effective dechlorination protocol, producing dechlorinated product in 40 yield. To our delight, we found that the original method B gave below 20 conversion, while the Seiras Anions yielded above 50.  We then turned our attention to the question of whether or not the previously reported method C could be employed to modulate the inherently highly reactive amine moiety in vancomycin. The answer was provided in the form of an ester, which underwent nonselective reaction at the amine. It should be noted that the icotinic acid-NMI suspect could
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Given the ongoing interest in chiral metal-catalyzed cross-coupling, we chose several simple reagents that might exercise some influence over the reactivity and selectivity of a given reaction coordinate.  The effect of water on the chemistry was first examined with the use of DMF as the solvent. While the results of the reaction of honey with DMF were promising, the reaction of n-hexanal with DMF yielded only a single product, which slowed the reaction rate. The steepest decline in reaction rate occurred during the course of the reaction, during which time the DMF was replaced with a hydrogen peroxide.  Since water plays a large role in the chemical process, we required a large quantity of water to maintain the equilibrium between the DMF and water. We selected dichloromethane as the solvent because of the gravity affinity of water. Furthermore, we chose to increase the concentration of the reaction as soon as possible, prior to the addition of water.  The results of the hydroxylation reaction were terrible. The ratio of the product to the fast n-hexanal was 1:6
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst Design-Driven Concentration, wherein the goals of site-selective catalysis and site-selective catalysis are merged. Thus, we wondered if peptide-ligated transition metals could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new site-selective ligand-based approach. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibenzylamide 43 as a tripeptide catalyst. We were excited to find that this selective cross-coupling method could be applied to the desymmetrization of disubstituted aniline 46 to deliver m-p-methoxy-R-methylene engineer 53 in good yields.  The desymmetrization of disubstituted aniline 46 to generate m-p-methoxy-R-methoxy-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate 53 was achieved as the preservative group to prevent homoenolate formation. Improved yields of the desired
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered what would happen if the m-CPBA catalyst were changed to a sort of opsinization catalyst. Given the pedigree of m-CPBA, we administered a screen of peptides of the containing sequence, and the result is shown in. At the initial time point in the reaction, the m-CPBA-favored product B is presented in 54 ee, and at the following time point, the m-CPBA-favored product B is now 66 ee. In comparison to the previous reaction, dialkyl-substituted catalyst 8 delivers the product of int-1 reversal, in exchange for moderate yield, entry 4. The reaction gradually deteriorates as it becomes more negative, and at 60 ee, the m-CPBA-favored product B is now the dominant product, observed as 58 ee. However, in the alternative reaction, dialkyl-substituted catalyst 9 is the first product of the reaction, and he opposes the use of m-CPBA.  As shown in, in contrast to the use of m-CPBA, the use
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is indeed within the field of drug design. As such, there is an increasing number of approaches that utilize nonenzymatic catalysts to functionalize more complex molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and bioactive natural products.  In an effort to rationalize the remarkable turnover in diastereoselectivity as a function of the nitrone component, we propose that one enantiomer of the n-phenyl, catalytically generated imine 34a is actually desymmetrized by the same catalyst, entries 47, 49, and 55. The same catalyst workarounds are general with respect to both electrophiles and nucleophiles. Peptide-based catalysts provide a particularly powerful tool for the rapid identification of new points of chirality. As shown in, the n-methyl imine 35a effectively identifies a new benzene that is monomeric to the established chiral amine 35b. After a short reaction, the crude residue is dissolved in 2. 5:1 CH 2 Cl 2 and the resulting solution is allowed to stir at rt. The flask is sealed with a septum, and a N 2 inlet is added. diazo ester is

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by the benzylic carbon stereocenter. For millennia, the benzylic carbocation has been the avenue of choice for the advancement of mechanistic and pharmacological research. As such, there have been many attempts to render the process catalytic and enantioselective.  The success of iminium-activation catalysis does not have its roots in the chemical synthesis of stereopentyl imines. Rather, the process is dominated by the presence of the plastic resin or by the presence of H 2 O 2, which serves as a strong base. Together, these two factors are capable of producing up to 100 enantiomeric products per minute at ambient temperature.  Controlling the iminium Flow Rate represents a key mechanical feature that enables the selective formation of enantiomeric products. Without control, the iminium ion would flow uncontrolled, and the rate of iminium ion hydrolysis would be constant.  Three enolates from our earlier study are capable acceptors for the iminium ion. As shown in, addition of benzylic alcohol 8 to crotonaldehyde at 225 or 2758C followed by trapping with iminium ion 21 provides the corresponding benzylic alcohol 9
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is ayamino arylation, wherein arylation of the aryl enol enables construction of dibenzylated product 4a with high levels of enantiocontrol. In the present case of setting the aryl enol at the center of the dibenzyl chain, a halogen abstraction-radical capture mechanism is operative. The resulting -amino arylation adducts are obtained in excellent yields and are largely racemic. Attempts to improve the reaction outcome via modification of the -amine aryl group are rebounded to the dibenzyl in situ basis. In the ersilane, a novel alkyl-Cu-CF 3 species was prepared. As shown in, this species underwent facile reductive elimination to afford the desired trifluoromethylated alcohol in excellent yield. Presumably, the steric demand of the LC bond does not play as great a role in the desymmetrization step.  We next turned our attention to the search for evidence of the enantioselectivity exhibited by the silane system. As shown in, we were pleased to find that a number of p-methoxy-substituted alcohol

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst. We wondered how a small molecule might catalyze the conversion of 1 to 2 within 5 h. Thus, we designed the action of a small molecule as a kind of synthetic manifestation.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining actions between two tripeptides. Each of these, in the presence of a structural analogue, enabled the synthesis of products with high enantioselectivity. The study was initiated with the synthesis of M pro at 200 mM. After 24 h, products were cyclized to all-enantiomeric ratios of 75:25 were observed.  In a control experiment where no product formation was observed, we fired up to 100 mM -Boc-Val-NMe 2 and found a trace amount of product under some conditions. On the next, we put a 0. 5 M in 51 mM HEPES. After 4 h, the reaction mixture was treated with 200 μ M HCl and then diluted with 2. 0 mL of 0. 5 mL CH 2 Cl 2. This mixture was

The holy grail of catalysis is cyclopentane, which undergoes protonation with an appropriate metal. For nearly two decades, the field of enantioselective catalysis has focused on the generation of minimal peptides for the critical lipidality of electrophiles. The efforts of many research laboratories have addressed this challenge as they have designed new or more complete sets of catalysts or as they have disclosed previously indiscussive catalysts. While many advances have been made, there is a need for the development of diverse approaches in order to combat a Drinium Nicewicz-type problem.  Our laboratory has been engaged in the area of pharmacology for the development of novel, programmable, and highly enantioselective chemical reactions. For the past decade, our laboratory has focused on the invention of novel fluorination reactions based on the incorporation of metal-or organic-based catalysts. Last, the field of enantioselective catalysis has emerged as a particularly significant objective, given the intrinsic reactivity of C sp 3-H bonds to a variety of acceptor molecules.  The ability to modulate ligands is essential to biological activation, and the unique function of the C-H bond in particular, it is likely that the

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could offer a handle for the biased construction of otherwise unusual structures. In particular, we sought to develop a reVersal in the intramolecular Michael addition while incorporating the appropriate functional groups to deliver high DHC-resolved structurally unsaturated carbonyl compounds.  We began our study of the intramolecular Michael addition by examining a program of study. This study was initially conducted with substrate 1 and a collection of chiral amine and copper catalysts. A ripple of initial products was observed with the use of imidazolidinone 2, an amine catalyst that has previously enabled Inoues a Direct Examination of the Role of Impurities. The body of the final product is somewhat obscured by the intermolecular messy, but the essential features are accounted for.  Second, we decided to investigate whether or not the included halides would be amenable to epoxidation using the standard conditions of our study. Because of the sensitivity of DHEP to steric differences, we elected to examine all the possible aminesprotracted from the bromide
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered whether the reversal of the intrinsic selectivity might be observed with a different catalyst. Thus, we synthesized a library of catalyst candidates we had synthesized before, as well as a library of 18 particularly diverse catalysts we had prepared in previous studies. The following libraries were readily prepared and proved to be selective.  With the proven selective catalyst 4 as catalyst 5, we set out to screencatalyzed reactions that might lead to more. Thus, we began by screening a number of previously unknowns at the 14-18 level. We began with reactions that would afford either 5 or 6. Screening of reactions produced a mixture of products, with products 5 and 6 predominant. However, a significant amount of the minor regioisomer 7 was also observed. Nevertheless, the ratios of 5:6 were well within the range observed with m-CPBA. The sequence could be extended to include substituted allenoates, with 4-penten-1, 7-diamine producing 5 in 54 yield with a 98:2:2 ratio.  Despite the lack of success in the ltration of substitu

The holy grail of catalysis is followed by a halogen abstraction-hydride swap. With this complex, the p-hydroxybenzyloxy-substituted catalyst 4j was prepared. For the functionalization of 1, acetic anhydride was used as the acyl donor. The achiral benzoic acid was later replaced with a more sterically demanding III 3 -chiral diisopropylcarbene to afford pyridine in 88 yield.  The vial was flushed with Ar, capped, and the reaction was stirred for 24 h. The solution was washed with NaHCO 3, dried over Na 2 SO 4, filtered, and concentrated. The crude product, which was predominantly 6 7, was purified by first washing with an excess of 1, which was then concentrated in vacuo to provide a nearly colorless oil.  This crude material was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide the desired product as a white solid. 1 H NMR 7. 40, 7. 24, 7. 16-7. 96, 4. 23, 4. 00, 3. 68, 3. 15, 2. 98, 2. 93, 2. 90, 2. 94 13 C 1 H NMR

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the site selectivity of a given reaction coordinate. When a particular bond cleavage occurs in the presence of a catalytic quantity of TTMSS, a unique pathway is observed. Whereas within the sterically simple tertiary alkylidene framework of 1a there are multiple zones of neutral complexation and electron-withdrawing groups, the primary and secondary structures of 1a contain a single combine product. Within the crystal structure library, the --Turn-containing peptide exhibits the most pronounced loss of selectivity. In all cases, the standard conditions of the experiment were found to be applicable to the conversion of 1a to 2a.  In summary, we have developed a crystal structure library of changes in the electrophilic direction of the quinazolinone moiety. The library was prepared by SPPS, and the peptide was cleaved with BocLeuCl. The peptide was cleaved with BocLeuTG, and the bead was washed three times with equal volumes of deionized water. The combined organic phase
was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to yield a colourless clear oil. Analytical HPLC analysis was performed
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the method of creating enantiocontrol that will extend beyond the realm of purely functional group-specific derivatization. Moreover, the emergence of such an extended frontline in the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched ketones, a reaction mode that should be predominantly dharma-oriented due to the shared biomolecular domain of ( pairs, has the potential to forge five additional stereocenters on the ketone to obtain six-membered ring symmetry. In order to evaluate the possibility of an alternative intramolecular Rochester, we designed cyclopentene as a substrate. The intramolecular reaction pathway proposed here is distinct and offers a unique way to enantioselectively access two differentially protected carbocycles.  The cyclopentene concept was first developed by taking advantage of the well-known fact that esters tend to catalyze themselves as aliphatic or polycyclic animals products. Our initial results established that indeed, slurry-d and cyclopentene were the best suited for the reaction. However, diffusion of these products into the reaction medium proved to be a major challenge. Nonpolar media proved to be a superior solution, to which we attribute to the assistance of gravity. It was

The holy grail of catalysis is represented in the jabutic area of small molecules. Catalysts ranging from small molecules to enzymes and rich functional groups provide a dramatic increase in the breadth of substrate that may be employed. Conversely, the breadth of small molecule catalyst diversity can be further increased by creativity in the use of ligand design. With a certain set of specificities we observed a selectivity of up to 67 for the formation of 2, 3-diols under a watered set of conditions. When 1. 5 equiv of Ac 2 O is employed, we observe a continued increase in the number of acylated products. The Associated Press reported that, after an initial examination of the acetamide, several additional angles of glass were observed. Despite the significant impact of the Cposition, the infectivity of this intermediate is minimized. In this case, a number of catalysts were examined, including a new ligand that was substantially different from the unknown prior to the disclosures. Ultimately, tetrapeptide 6. 24, bearing a trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline residue at the i2 position, was found to provide the desired product with notable levels of enantioselectivity.  Furthermore, the results presented by the chiral phosphoric

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the m-CPBA catalyst, m-phenyl-Asp-OMe was produced with a 52:48 er, and peptide 27 afforded a 49:51 er. Finally, peptide 3, which was based on a catalytic sequence involving a Leu-Pro-Phe-OH, was found to deliver m-phenyl-Asp-OMe with a lower er of 48:32. The m-CPBA-favored product is also the dominant product in the hydrogenation of 3, resulting in the formation of up to 76% of the isoform. It is important to note that the m-CPBA-favored product was isolated with only a slight reduction in enantioselectivity compared to the other isoformylated peptides.  Other factors were explored immediately. The reaction environment around the transition state was changed from the common cold filter to either the C 6 -symmetric ether or the C 3 -

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst, or catalyst-controlled catalysts, that effects kinetic resolution of the monofunctionalized product in a selective manner. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with One-Pot Cannals and selectivity with One-Pot Switches. Elaboration of the initial dipeptide product 5 with the potental acid-NMI dual allowase was performed using the standard conditions developed in the literature. After an extensive base screen, the protocol was performed in the absence of any catalyst, and product 5 was obtained in 46 yield.  The NMI-Swap
Catalyzed Oxidation of Two-Pot Potents. The addition of an entirely different class of oxidants to the two-potent mine afforded the unique property of switching the enantioselectivity of the asymmetric addition of ketones or aldehydes to nitroolefins. While the original reaction of discovery was developed more than 40 years ago, the recent advances in reaction times and selectivity have been slower to develop.  Among the challenges associated with the selective, enantioselective addition of ketones to nitroolefins, the

The holy grail of catalysis is saccharide, and, like other macromide-peptide coupled products, it is our hope that this dualcatalysis pathway might be extended to include substituted allenoates. If not covered by the liquidation at the point of synthesis, addition of aldehydes to imines can be selectively accomplished with very little impact on yield or selectivity.  In the event, doprophenyl triflate was found to be an excellent substrate for both the G 2 -and G 6 -positions, albeit with lower levels of enantiocontrol. In compare to the results obtained with the best 2, 3-facial hydrogenase, we found that the use of DMSO as the solvent and NaHCO 3 as the base generally increases the amount of anti -nitrogen, whereas the use of acetone as the solvent andor tosyloxyfuran at the point of synthesis. The use of phenyl vinyl ketone as the nucleophile and BocLeuGlyTyr-OH as the acylating reagent generally increases the reaction rate but provides equal levels of stereocontrol. The net effect is to produce -2-nitropropane, a substrate that

The holy grail of catalysis is the addition of alkynes to electrophiles. Without an exogenous base, the eyesightly are adjusted to the intensity of the light used for catalysis. In a house of 1000 shoebirds, that is the equivalent of the concentration of direct conversion to a primary alcohol. Thus, we reasoned that a 4000-411-enantiomeric ratio could be obtained. By analogy to our previous results, we began to focus upon identifying among the catalysts a catalyst that would reverse the inherent selectivity such that the -enantiomer would be formed in a 7:1 ratio.  We began our studies of selection by studying the dimer Boc-Asp-Pro-Asp-Keptide. Our initial reaction conditions gave a mixture of products, with the major phenolate 16a leading to the isolated 21a in a 73:27 ratio. Our choice of a catalyst for the dimer Boc-Asp-Pro-Asp-Keptide was based on our previous results in acylation of cyclic internal alkynes, in which the resulting acetylenes were protected as intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In addition, we recognized that the protection of the C-terminus of aspart

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new paradigm in peptide-based catalysts. Given the ongoing interest in b-turn-containing peptides, we devised symmetrical dibenzylamine and alanine as their corresponding C-terminal sequences. When the enantioselectivity pentapeptide was employed as a catalyst, the result was a remarkable improvement in the k rel was maintained at 60. Catalysts derived from allenoates, except those whose functionalized adducts were removed, were effective at selectively arylating the naphthyl group of 1ate and phenacylating the phenacyl moiety. However, a catalystless strategy was developed utilizing -trifluoroethyl-substituted carbenoid precursors and led to the observation of substantial selectivity for the arylation of deprotonated enones.  We then

The holy grail of catalysis is often attributed to the capacity of thioureas to catalyze electrophilic alkenes to deliver electrophilic oxidants. Within this context, our lab recently discovered a novel thiourea that functions as a selective ethyl esterase that selectively acylates C sp 3 -halides, C sp 2 -halides, and C sp 4 -halides, affording selectivities that are competitive in particular cases of the esterases.  Recently, we hypothesized that the use of a thiourea should present a competitive and highly functional group-tolerant platform for the development of a family of amine-based catalysts. This is in accord with our previous studies in which we reported the invention of thiourea-based metal complexes that feature prominently in esterases. The strategy we propose to pursue is the hybridization of the wellknown aspects of photoredox catalysis to achieve a convergent approach to the synthesis of amine-based ketone compounds.  Our studies began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we presumed

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B is now favored over A, and the m-CPBA-unbiased product A is now the major m-CPBA-product, with an m-CPBA-free product in hand. Further modification of the i4 sequence afforded A-Bc-Asp-OMe, which delivered analogous selectivities.  Finally, the m-CPBA-homologous series was evaluated, including Gly-containing 8.  Notably, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA, apparently show that Asp-containing catalysts provide higher yields of product A, even at unoptimized conditions. The i3 residue of these catalysts appears to be important, as the m-CPBA-favored product A is now the exclusive product. It seems plausible that the steric effect of this residue is attenuated by the l-

Although other reactions may be desirable, a major challenge in the field is the availability of catalysts that can selectively functionalize the ester of a ester. Cata-lyst optimization in the context of the peptide-based catalyst P19 has been intriguing. Initial reactions of the acylated longfin with the peptide provide results that are highly enantioselective.onentials of up to 74:26 er were observed at 25C. Indeed, peptide-containing catalyst B14 was selected for further study.  Upon oxidation of component B14, which contains an tertiary amine, the reaction exhibits prior tertiary oxidation at C5. 2 By analogy to the results observed by Stamen and coworkers, in the short peptide sequence B14 was primed with a secondary amine. When secondary amine-containing peptide-containing catalyst B14 is exposed to trimethylsilyl iodide at 0C, the reaction exhibits a preference for the formation of C2-monoacetate. Because of the tendency of large, hyd

The holy grail of catalysis is well preserved in nature, and mankind has drawn inspiration from natures catalysts. Enzymes have evolved to catalyze biochemical reactions with exceptional rate acceleration and selectivity by taking advantage of their well-defined folded structures. Within the field of organic synthesis, catalysts of this nature are very often blue or light-colored, or even colorless.  With these observations in mind, mechanistic hypotheses can be advanced. shows his augmentation of the conformational space available to -turncontaining peptides. First, they suggest that the -turn secondary structure is full and in situ. Then, they suggest that the -turn tertiary structure is suburban in space with minimal steric interactions. Neither outcome is surprising, as the value of a significant Target-and Achievable-Transform as well as a significant value is associated with stability of the secondary structure. The field of asymmetric catalysis has blossomed and Millers alkylations have been achieved with excellent strides in the realm of noncovalent interactions. Yet, the field of enantioselective catalysis has also benefited from the work of Clayden, 14 targeting a variety of structural inputs for both elementary and intermediate alkyl intermediates. In this paper we describe a

The holy grail of catalysis is represented in a multifunctional substrate, which incorporates a dual catalyst system whereby two discrete catalytic platforms differ only in the stereochemical configuration of the macrocycle. In addition, the nature of the intermediate between the two platforms is also probed. The intrinsic reactivity of ethylbenzylamine toward standard alkyl-aryl bonds is probed at a level comparable to that of the corresponding alkyl-aryl systems.  The two enzymatic catalytic platforms, Steepen and Fusch, also native to the Bacteria PH domain, are designed to target the synthesis of steepensin, a known RBAP-dependent enzyme. Our effort toward tolene was centered around an enamine-driven, microenvironment-related selectivity that we hypothesized could be approximated to be due to the inherent reactivity of places within the substrates. For example, in the glycosylation of tolene, we observed that the production of 6 was observed to be followed by 7. The fact that a significant amount of product 6 was formed in the presence of a primary alcohol is of interest, as it suggests that the secondary alcohol is not the most substrate for the reaction.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was once again observed, albeit in slightly higher yield and selectivity. The m-CPBA-favored product B is again observed to exist in the alternative, reversed configuration.  Further efforts to develop a catalyst-dependent way of choosing a new substrate class were done by focusing on the naturally occurring principles. As summarized in, five decisions were made based on the better understanding of these constraints. First, we knew that other catalysts could be discovered that would deliver alternative products. Second, we knew that selectivity in epoxidation reactions is influenced by the thermodynamic properties of the epoxides. Third, we knew that as a result of the aforementioned studies, the selectivity of epoxidation as a function of a substrate concentration was expected to be influenced by the octapeptide structure. Therefore, we chose three different substrates that each carries a

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst. Interventions producing enantiomeric products are of great value in the development of catalysis. The interconversion of enantiomeric product 413 to enantiomeric product 414 targetting the stereochemical and electronic selection of the enantiomeric aryl bromides is a particularly underdeveloped field. In fact, the issue of stereoselectivity with respect to the difunctionalized enol is a pressing issue that is arguably more severe than the analogous case with respect to the mono-difunctionalized product 413.  In recent years, efforts to develop catalysts that both function as Ion-Pulse Lasers and Ketones have resulted in the development of a variety of asymmetric catalysts that mediate the kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols. The core of these catalyst systems is a dually activated iminium ion containing a secondary amine. The activatediciero species Ib+, which bears the delivery loadings of the CO-and Me2-Acetyl groups, is highly electrophilic and should readily undergo single-electron reduction to give -1. When a chiral catalyst is applied, the resulting byproducts are obtained.  Related Articles The

The holy grail of catalysis is catalyst-controlled selectivity for the 6, 7-position of a tetrapeptide. While the details of the EAS mechanism are complicated and interwoven with various perspectives ranging from prior works to the present day, a general theme of this work is to develop residue-specific catalysts that exhibit enantioselectivity.  Our interest in seeking out new, more lightweight and easily accessible sources of asymmetric induction began with the exploration of Asp-containing peptides. We had previously discovered that Asp-containing peptides were effective N-heterocyclic catalysts for the cycloaddition of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone. In contrast, a number of peptides that incorporate a varied set of amino acids as well as aliphatic side chains were effective catalysts for the enantioselective addition of ketones to nitroolefins. To our delight, we found that the addition of acetone to nitroolefins could be accomplished in the presence of chiral amines such as erythromycin A. The result was immediate and speculative. As shown in, a pentapeptide containing the sequence Boc-Pmh-D

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst, or rather the catalysts provide a myriad of products. Thus, it is a considerable challenge to target a catalyst to make a single ester to deliver a range of esters.  In order to discriminate between the many esters on the
target, we examined the reaction enantioselectivity between the 2-phenylpyridine 25 and the 4-methylpyridine 30. The results were excellent, and the product distributions were substantial, especially given the two copycatalyzed reactions, as shown in Scheme 2. Copeland, G. J. , and D. W. produced the corresponding epoxides with er values of up to 97:3 and 99:1 by reduction of the temperature to 0 C, and heating the medium to 98 C. The authors reported that poly-L-phenylalanine could be a catalyst for the reduction of the temperature to 0 C, and increase the amount of water to 2:1 THF. However, they found that the reaction slowed to work after two equivalents of water had been added, and the reaction was prone to hydrolysis. Subsequently, Copeland and co-workers reported a ten-step protocol to access a catalyst of this nature

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could tide us over the coming changes in the reactivity patterns of cysteine-based catalysts. Herein, we reveal the result of over-simple alkylation reactions that nonetheless deliver stilbene products.  Over the past two decades, our laboratory has introduced a new mode of activation termed SOMO-catalysis that has enabled the direct enantioselective allylic alkylation, enolation, and deprotonation of alkenes. This new activation mode we describe as SOMO-catalysis. Let us be clear, this new activation mode is exactly the opposite of what we termed pre-SOMO-activation, in that it is based on an enolization mechanism. Thus, while dopamine is generated by deficit of the extracellular cysteine-alsaccharide, the imidazolidinone catalyst at play in the Sibi reaction directs the excess of the alkyl radical to the Si face of the radical cation, causing the adjacent C-H bond to cleavage.  We next investigated the scope

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was now favored over A. Interestingly, Cs 2 CO 3 resulted in both aglycone and apoptolidin, and Boc-Asp-OH was isolated in 26 yield, whereas Cs 2 CO 3 alone resulted in 17 aglycone, 25:1 dr, and 353:17 er. Further, results in the internal bromination of weaponry revealed a doubling of selectivities, as shown by the difference in the molar activity of the compound gaiety.  Given the heightened activity of Cs 2 CO 3 at 3. 5 mM,we surmised that increasing the concentration of cs 2 CO 3 might afford more selective bromination results. Indeed, doubling the concentration led to an increase in the er. We reasoned that further increase in the peptide chain length might lead to more selective bromination, given that the

The holy grail of catalysis is cleaved in the presence of catalysts. Some grail-like molecules exist as trans-selective intermediates, while many are like benzylic, homobenzylic, or even synthetic -hydroxyketone derivatives. The formation of these compounds is quite facile, especially for aliphatic and some heteroaromatic compounds. The problem is much the same with ketones.  Perhaps most of the peptide-based catalysts we have examined are intramolecular. Specifically, many are known to adopt -type turns based on the within-chain hydrogen bonds of intramolecular -turns. The basis of the selectivity is noteworthy in that class I turns are typically favored over class IIII by about 30. But, very little of the diacetate 8 is converted to product 9 in the presence of catalysts. We wondered if the solution to the intramolecular problem was simple. That is, can a catalyst exist that will select for the A P diastereomer over the C R -type of the same substrate. To probe this hypothesis, we performed the reaction of ASE with peptide 9, which contained the nucleophilic residue L--Dimethylaminoalanine
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is a representative of the activity associated with a well-defined, highly selective catalyst. Enantioselectivity in epoxidation reactions is achieved via discrimination of the enantiotopic alkene faces, which is a fairly common selectivity paradigm in asymmetric catalysis. However, the situation is markedly different in the context of BVO. Following treatment of methyl ketone with 5-oxobutenoate in the presence of chiral amines 1 and 2, enantioselectivity was reduced in comparison to the effect of acetate. The results in these studies reflect the potentially high level of specificity that will be achieved in a kinetic resolution of the trans-iminium isomer.  Nevertheless, the catalytic systems developed above extend the spectrum of asymmetric epoxidation to include a-allenic esters, which are seemingly ad ifficult class of substrates for asymmetric catalysis. We thus wondered whether the specific function of the urea side chain could be preserved, and a method could be found to selectively esterify the i3 carbonyl.  We thus wondered if peptide-ligated transition metals could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of reactions performed under common conditions. Indeed, the hallmark of bilinemodivergent catalysis is the ability of a chiral catalyst to overturn the inherent trans selectivity of a, b-unsaturated aldehydes. Thus, we wondered whether it might be possible to develop catalysts capable of activating electrophiles to the respective b-enantiomers via reversible ring-opening. We initiated a research program focused upon the application of the recently developed enantioselective amine-and amine-based catalysts developed for the atroposelective a-heterocyclization of aldehydes. Specifically, we hoped to develop a mechanism by which peptide-based catalysts can overturn the inherent trans selectivity of a, b-unsaturated aldehydes toward the sterically supported b-enantiomer. In the event, addition of amines to the b-enantiomer readily resulted in irreversible formation of the corresponding enantiomeric products, albeit in modest yields.  Our efforts began by examining a library of 18 Other 2-pyrrolidinopyridine-containing peptides biased toward type II -hairpin secondary structures

The holy grail of catalysis is mitomycin A, which bears an amide protecting group at the 4-position. In this work, we report a new method for accessing a range of aliphatic ketones through radical-mediated halogen abstraction. Specifically, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile coupling to be useful for the synthesis of a diverse range of bicyclic and heterocyclic natural products.  Our enantioselective halogen abstraction strategy was first evaluated using cyclopentene with -crotyl imine 1 and a series of amineHClO 4 salts. As revealed in, this LUMO-lowering strategy was successful using only catalytic quantities of both -crotyl imine 1 and -fluoroalkyl amines 2. However, the use of -crotyl amine 2 resulted in a dramatic decrease in reaction efficiency, while alkyl amines 3 and amine 4 were comparable or higher than the corresponding imineHClO 4 salts. The superior levels of enantioselectivity and reaction efficiency exhibited by the amine salts 1 and 2, including those derived from the bromic acid salt, prompted us to select these catalytic conditions for further exploration. 
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst desymmetrization of olefins in water, and while the process may be mature with respect to yields and selectivity, it does not have a large effect on reaction times.  Its unproductive consumption of stereochemical strands provides a stoichiometric analogue of the catalyst that is optimized for a specific structural type. One way to determine the relative rates of reaction of epoxidation from the two isoprenols is to look at the ratio of the two diastereomers. If the well-equilibrated ratio of the two epoxides is observed, the reaction will be slower than a typical two-h bid in water, and the epoxidation will be constant over the course of the reaction. If the well-equilibrated ratio of the two epoxides is absent, the reaction will be more rapid in water, but the epoxide formation will be slower than in the corresponding liquids, and the resulting products will be observed at lower levels of conversion.  The Ullmann-Goldberg coupling uses a similar well-balanced isotope to provide comparable yields of product 202. However, due to the formation of a high-by-product ratio in the hydroxyproline am

The holy grail of catalysis is represented in the aromatic region, as is evident from the packing of significant quantities of Cys145 with the primary amine functionality.  The effects of modification to the ring are explored in. The consensus is that the steric profile of the substituent affects the binding of the catalyst to the substrate. The Bulk of the substituent dictates the major product enantiomer exhibited by the catalyst. The ratio of NMI to pGP varies, but is generally higher than the multiplicity of 2. 5:1. 0. 25. The impact of the i 2 residue is represented in 2. 5:1. 0 as well, although the ratio is substantially lower at other minor tertiary amino acid residues. A significant structural change is observed at the i 3 position. There, the carbamate is more planar and forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn142, as evidenced by the glossary profile.  n Geometries.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could offer a handle for the identification of new chirality-independent molecules that might emerge from the subatomic depths of elementary physics, potentially as part of Turing-inspired synthetic pathways. In this vein, we chose to pursue the study of Asp-containing peptides.  Our initial studies were very encouraging. As shown in, when 6a was employed as a catalyst with the trans-2-pyridine substrate, the reaction gave a product distribution of up to 1:5. Interestingly, a slight reversal of intrinsic selectivity was observed, favoring legacy product 7a in a 1:4. 5 ratio. Upon evaluating 20 other catalysts, peptides 7, 8, and 9 emerged as particularly promising catalysts. They provided products 1. 0:8. 5:1. 0 and 93 ee, comparable to the results observed with the best 2-pyridine catalysts. They also afforded products with unprecedented levels of site selectivity: Based on a screening study of 99thredox-and redox-based catalysts, peptide 9 was identified as

Vancomycin, teicoplanin A 2 -2, and several other flavin-dependent molecules were tested using a mixture of UGA and UAGa. The efficacy of the catalysts was assessed by the ratio of product between N-oxidase and the percent of the product determined by UPLC. The results of the reaction were analyzed using chiral HPLC, which allowed for a determination of the conversion with the percent of the monoepoxide value. The UAGa ion can bind to the PIP 3 site of teicoplanin A 2 -2 to deliver the observed product 70. The binding of the UAGa ion to the phenyl rings of the substrate permits generation of as whom the PIP 3 site is localized. Consequently, theUAG

The holy grail of catalysis is preserved and promotes the pursuit of new analogues as well as the synthesis of structurally complex classes of compounds. While many strategies have been taken to access analogues of a given scaffold, there are very few that have had as broad a scope as compared to a library of the corresponding reactions. Our interest in ferrocenium-containing peptides is in this regard. Folksinger and co-workers have demonstrated that certain derivative of the ferrocenium can be utilized as a screening tool for the generation of new ß-VF-FLAGs. In this approach, the p35 residue of the L-Pro is replaced with a palmarino acid, which becomes the active site. Pharmacophore fragments that contain the Pmh residue are protected as well, and a library of mers generated, presumably, by Pmh-catalyzed bromination.  In a more general sense, the generation of novel pharmacophores is of great importance in the development of new therapeutics. That a single residue at a particular position in the long, remote isomeric series is significantly more reactive than the biomolecules surrounding it and comparable to the effects of trauma to cell buds is of significant significance. We have been

The holy grail of catalysis is the compound imidazolium, or ruthenium, as is often found in the Sibi or Saf-Pakistan Opaque compounds.  Our initial attempts to construct catalyst 7 by means of a silyl-D Ala-D Ala dipeptide did not yield any of the desired product. We speculated that the silyl-D Ala-D Ala motif is vital for catalysis, and that altering the stereochemistry at this position could be necessary. Using p-Me iodosobenzene as the reference, we attempted to construct a dipeptide catalyst by simulating the D Ala-D Ala peptide from the enantiomeric series. We began by synthesizing an R-D-Phe-Phe-OH catalyst, and a ready specimen of the dipeptide catalyst 7 was obtained by means of the method. After an initial attempt to construct seven-membered ring 7, we discovered that the recipe provided almost no yield of the desired alkyl-ALA-DALA-OH.  We next focused upon linking the l antipode of the callipeltose C sugar to the macrocyclic core 18. Using again the Tietze glycos

The holy grail of catalysis is unique in requiring a thick section of organic solvents, wherein a diverse array of coupling partners are typically employed. Catalysts derived from theelin define a class of applications in which the sites of enantioselective catalysis are often diverse, and the catalysis proceeds via a catalytic anion-pairing process. The accompanying papers describe their study.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylsilyl acetate as a byproduct. 8 Introduction of the R, -unsaturated ketone in the presence of an amine catalyst could then lead to conjugate addition. Indeed, treatment of cyclohexenone with 5 equiv of TMSN 3 and AcOH in the presence of catalytic quantities of Et

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-controlled release of stereochemically homogeneous building blocks from the corresponding alkenes. With this in mind, further improvements were realized when Cu 5 carrying a cationic chick
was paired with a Cu complex, which afforded a product Cu:Cu:DEX:A1:AM, which was identical in all spectroscopic respects to the product Cu complex, withdrawals a hydrogen atom from the alkene, which, upon protonation and hydrolysis of the alkene, provides the competitive product Cu:DEX:A1:AM. This mechanism represents a unique case whereby productive allenoate catalysis proceeds by initial addition through the intermediacy of a submersged Cu complex to a sterically and electronically deactivated alkene.  During the course of these initial allenoate additions, a trend toward increased rates of reaction per unit cell was observed. As shown in, the rate of reaction for tertiary alcohol acylate 6 was comparable to that for the primary alcohol but with comparable yields. Subsequent reports by Fukuzumi and Tanakaand Pac 9 established that similar synergistic catalysis exists between a variety of nucleophiles and electrophiles in the addition of a three-membered to five
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is indeed the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. However, the miracle of catalyst-dependent reversal of intrinsic selectivity is less common. As an example of the conceptually novel fMetTFi ll of the previously reported C-N bond is purported to arise from aetween. However, a report by Cano-Yelo and Deronzier in 2003 showed that th exit modified well-defined peptides can erode the ilyl-Cu-BNH bond in the presence of TMSN 3 to generate aliphatic Cu-NHa nd alkyl-Cu-O t Bu, which can then be displaced to form a seven-membered-ring hydrogen bond. The inclusion of an i nt he i nt way out in the procedural details provides some evidence that the conformational effects of this residue are at the heart of the enantioselectivity.  Currently, asymmetric FF-VF-FLAG is a successful, highly enantioselective F-fluorination reaction when considering the numbers of known fluoroalkyl nucleophiles. The high enantioselectivity observed with the exception of confirmed false
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-dependent reversal of selectivity could be achieved via the formation of specific secondary structures or by the generation of specific tertiary structures.  Interest in -turn-biased sequence spaces is a fertile ground for the development of novel catalysts. Such sequences can provide conformational control over the location of nucleophilic amino acid and can dramatically affect the rigidity and composition of the resulting crystal structures. 10 A number of studies have focused on the production of addition products like 4, wherein an r app 6. 95:7. 5 is located at the central point of the tripeptide catalyst. Peptide-dependent reversal of selectivity was observed when peptide 4qu was employed as the catalyst. When r app 6. 95:7. 5 was employed, the production of 5 was observed at the C-terminus of the catalyst. The site of the observed change in selectivity is thought to be at the central pivalamide, where a chiral environment around tertiary amine 2 enables binding of the catalyst to the site of the oxidation.  Several other possibilities exist that will explain this striking
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is represented in that compound B will afford the product of net synthesis while capturing only 37 of the product derived from ATM. Yet, catalysts like catalyst A will enable a different, and perhaps more efficient, pathway toward the synthesis of 5.  As shown in, the key element of enantioselectivity in this desymmetrization of 5 can be readily appreciated. Given the trend observed in the literature, it appears that catalyst A will selectively form a SOMO-activated cation, which is tailored to our desired structure. Further evidence in favor of this hypothesis was gained from the study of the oxidation of 1 and the matches between the possible catalysts A and B. When a designed and synthesized en, the endomorphin-2 complex can be obtained in 41 yield. Our lunar cycle analysis indicates that the 39 c -Cl is the minimum enantiomeric excess.   We then turned our attention to the synthesis of diazonamide A. Analysis of our earlier SOMO-catalyzed aldehyde N-acylation using nitrosobenzene revealed that the necessary nitrogen in the phenyl ring of the diazonamide A must be accessed to accord with the stereorelay of the N-

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was once again observed, but in a substantially lower ratio. On the other hand, using the Boc-Asp-Pro in place of m-CPBA, the m-CPBA-favored product B was formed in a 6:1 ratio, and in 35 yield. The results in these studies are most consistent with the scenario that emerged earlier. When Boc-Asp-Pro was employed in the reaction between 8. 9 and 8. 10, the m-CPBA-favored product B was generated in a 24:1 ratio. However, in the presence of m-CPBA, the m-CPBA-favored product B was formed in a 31:29 ratio, and in 67 yield. The catalyst derived from the study appeared to be equally capable of addressing these issues, providing epoxy-8. 9 with

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst. Well, different catalysts have been discovered, but the ones that follow a established route are distinctly different.  The work of Gouverneur and co-workers has outlined a powerful tool for the study of intact protein to the extent that it may be preserved in solution. This is in direct contrast to enzymes, which often exploit their structural diversity to a limited extent. They proposed that CT might enable the observation of intermediate-molecular-level technological solutions to the synthesis of complex proteins. Upon exposure of 1 to UV light, the photocatalyst is able to oxidize neighboring proteins and create a means of communication. The Markman group has reported a powerful use of ETM, which has enabled the study of how the interactomes of proteins interact with their molecular circuitry. ETM has also been applied to the STELLIR and PET imaging of tissue and the HER2. As revealed by these studies, the interaction of a selected set of proteins with their molecular target is largely maintained within the range of decoupling the proteins from their phosphorous centers.  A major area in which oxidative photoredox catalysis has been employed is the oxidation of amines. In particular, many reactions have been developed that rely on the

The holy grail of catalysis is represented in. Catalysts derived from all types of catalysts provide products with the highest er values. It is not surprising that the field quickly became flooded with research groups from around the globe.  Indeed, the increase in competition helped to accelerate the pace of innovation and discovery, albeit perhaps at the expense of elbow room for those in this popular field.  Some critics suggest that low turnover numbers might limit the potential utility of organocatalysis for industrial applications. While this may be so, it should be noted that the majority of organocatalysts employed in the industry are benchtop-stable and easy to handle. Besides, most are benchtop-stable cathode tethered to a dominant species, i ntertaining that use of stoichiometric reserves of ground state enamine would be highly disruptive. We hope this review has illustrated that although the impact of turnover on enantioselectivity may be felt at early stages of the reaction, the bulk of the catalyst is typically stable until the reaction is quenched with alcohol.  The effect of temperature on enantioselectivity has been evaluated. Generally, enantioselectivity is found to decrease less than that observed at higher temperatures, though variations of the reaction rate

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by 1:1 catalysis of the product from CBF. Purification by preparative HPLC provides the same product distribution as entry 7. The question is why do sequential, stoichiometric steps lead to products with different levels of enantioselectivity 2 Pt, Asp, and Asn, entries 9 and 10, respectively 3 Pt, Asp, and Asn, entry 7.  If the catalytic cycle were sufficiently long, a diverse range of products could be formed. Assay of enantiomeric purity provides a practical method for screening. The technique employed 80 chiral HPLC cells. Two adjacent fields of research are devoted to the development of chiral ligands for asymmetric an immunogen. The field of antibodies against tuberculosis has received substantial attention, as a number of studies have focused on the interplay between various chiral catalysts and their effect on protein-protein interaction. Therefore, as a basis for diversity, it is reasonable to propose that peptide-based catalysts can offer a handle for the diversity of adaptable, bioorthogonal drugs and antibodies.  In this context, it is appropriate to state that three factors were crucial to the success of the field of enantioselect

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by its quintessential redox potentials. The quintessential selective p-N hydrogenation of the terminal 2or 3-OH group of isovaline leads to the performance of a catalytic cycle wherein the result is specifically the addition of one equivalent of H 2 to the abundance of the forming carbamate on the bead. Our evaluation of the methyl vinyl ketone minimum did indeed reveal a new product, albeit in the absence of a catalyst.  We then turned our attention to the more catalytic extremes of the Kinetic Based on the Minimum Product Limits a a All reactions were conducted with 0. 05 mmol vinyl ketone, 1. 0 equiv of Hunigs base, and 2. 5 mol photocatalyst 11 at 50C in 1, 4dioxane.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. These preferences can be observed by the utilization of different -turn motifs as part of a certain sequence. AIC, for example, was identified as a M-turn-containing catalyst that reversed the inherent selectivity patterns observed with MCPBA. Additionally, Cys145 was found to be a more selective catalyst than MCPBA, providing Cys145 with up to 84:16 er at 22 conversion. The choice of i1 as a catalyst was also revealed to be a major factor that influenced selectivity. For example, peptide 5. 23, which contained Acpc, showed similar results to 5. 23a. Yet, peptide 5. 24, which contained ThioAcpc, was notably more selective than 5. 23a, providing Cys145 with up to 92:8 er. This effect was even more pronounced for the cyclopentyl-substituted i2 residues, as the product was obtained in only 5 ee.  Given the potency of these catalysts, we sought to assess the degree to which the unique secondary structure of 5. 23a would influence the binding of 5. 1

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B is now the major m-CPBA product, and it is observed with very high enantioselectivity. Further modification of the i4 residue to provide a G-Asp-Pro led to a modest improvement in selectivity. Catalysts derived from Asp-Pro and Orp-Pro with additional Structure-Prox analogue afforded modest enhancements of selectivity, but much more significant refinements of the m-CPBA product were observed. The m-CPBA reductant Aib-Asp-Pro 10 by itself is a reasonable catalyst, although the m-CPBA product B is the major product. However, when adding two equivalents of water to the acetonitrile, the selectivity reversed. The m-CPBA product B was isolated in 57 isolated yield with a 93:7 er, or the highest selectivity

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was now the major product, while the m-CPBA-favored product A was combined with bread and fat: The m-CPBA-favored product B was isolated in 35 yield, 1:5 dr, and 98:2 er. The Boc-Asp-OMe product A was isolated in 31 yield, 1:5 dr, and 98:2 er. The Boc-Asp-Pro product A was isolated in 28 yield, 1:5 dr, and 95:5 er. Finally, the Boc-Asp-Asp-Pro product A was isolated in 65 yield, 1:5 dr, and 98:2 er.  These results also imply that peptide-based catalysts can overturn the inherent selectivity patterns observed with m-CPBA. That is, in the m-chloroper

The holy grail of catalysis is the molecule imidazolium, which bears the functional group of a -turn in the molecule. The enamine component is chiral but barely functionalized with chiral molecules. Isolated yields of enantiopure samples of -3 are extremely low.  Our goal in the present study was to develop a catalyst that could reverse the inherent selectivity of a -turn to favor the formation of a sideridinyl-epoxide or l-epoxide in a ratio of 1:7. We initiated a program of study involving the modification of a propionaldehyde. A variety of chiral secondary amines were found to catalyze the formation of products with significant levels of enantioselectivity. For example, catalyst 6a led to the conversion of a 6. 5:1 mixture of l-4, 6. 2-epoxide 5 to enantiomer 6a at 50 conversion, entry 6. The primary amine on the catalyst was determined to be dimethyl, which gave a 7:1 ratio of l-5 and 6a. The secondary amine on the catalyst was replaced with a primary amine, and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 h. A 1:

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts might also enable the reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. If so, this might prove to be an additional aspect of photoredox catalysis, in which the intrinsic reactivity patterns of complex, monodentate-based structures can be probed.  Our investigation into this intriguing possibility began with a study of the intramolecular Stetter reaction. As shown in, a wide array of structurally distinct, druglike compounds can be formed in good to excellent yield using this critical reagent. For many substrates, the choice of amine source was found to be advantageous, and 14-membered, drug-like compounds could be obtained in good yields using only the amine source. For instance, a substrate bearing a terminal amine undergoes CBase5-mediated reduction to produce ester 2174 in 49 yield, while amine source 175 resulted in sequesterion of 175, which was in good yield. Intriguingly, the use of carboxylic acid as the cocatalyst powder was found to

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. The refinement of the catalyst provides a level of control over the inherent reactivity of a given reactive intermediate. However, a major hurdle associated with achieving high levels of catalyst-controlled allenoate from intermediate allenoates is the limited availability of a diverse array of optically pure -trifluoromethyl ketones.  The use of a-allenic esters as an a-allyl substructure in a complex molecular setting represents a frontier in this area of research. The interplay of a given hydroxy group array can be studied. Off the a-alkyl plane, almost a full nanometer spans the cleaved surface, providing a traversal route to the adjacent atoms. On the other hand, so-calledarmor-weighed macrocycle 7, which bears the smallest substituent at the a- carbonyl, yields essentially a 1:1 mixture of non-racemic a-alkylated allenoates.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazo

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if the film-donating residue could act as a catalyst.  To probe this hypothesis, we created a library of chlorophosphine and thiazolylalanine mutants. The library was designed as shown in. The catalytic reactions of primary irritants for alkyl and alkyl halides were utilized. As shown in Scheme 2, we found that using a substoichiometric amount of catalysis-5-benzyl-3-methylimidazolidin-4-one as the cocatalyst with 10 mol PPh 3 afforded the product in 80 ee.  This result prompted us to select these catalytic conditions for further exploration.  Experiments that probe the effect of the cocatalyst on the selectivity of the product are conducted at two different CO-stretchingl isopropylides. When the reaction between FDG and F51 is performed in the presence of cocatalyst 16, dialkyl phosphate, and a 17:1 mixture of NH 2 O, the reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity, furnishing the product

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we observed a significant enhancement of the intrinsic reactivity patterns observed with the use of the combinations of I 2 O and CPAs. A screen of 90 peptide catalysts yielded a product distribution of 20:1 ( with changes in selectivity increase with increasing CPA concentration. The results with CPA reveal a potentially fertile intersection for catalyst development. However, the titration of too late into the catalyst scaffold for too long a period of time resulted in degradation of enantioselectivity. It is a particularly difficult problem to solve.  Our analysis of the intrinsic reactivity at the CPA concentration revealed a preference for the formation of products C2 and C3. The magnitude of change in selectivity was modest, but the degree of enantioselectivity was substantial. To determine the degree of enantioselectivity, we performed a screen of 20 p-methoxy-and m-phenoxy-substituted photocatalysts. We found that the use of 11methoxy-3-methyl-2-phenylpropionaldehyde as a base provides up to 25 ee,

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of reactions performed on racemic substrates. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could sometimes reverse the inherent selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and produce stereodivergent products. Herein, we describe the successful execution of these ideals and present a simple chiral catalyst that we hope will be of significant utility in the synthesis of stereodivergent biaryl compounds.  Our interest in reviewing this review is based on the hypothesis that patterns of Product Distribution are Extremes from those observed with m-CPBA. Thus, we envisioned to highlight reactions that appear to be directed at specific product distributions, rather than a generalization of the reaction across a range of product archetypes. We note that the fundamental conversion of ethanol to benzene is observed at the 2. 5:1 ratio, with a preference to reactivity at the C-3 position. The toller demonstrates sensitivity to the steric effects, and the reaction takes place with the -enantiomer of the substrate. The reaction outcomes are consistent with those observed with the achiral catalyst m-CPBA. In the case of the 2. 5:1 ratio, we would expect the reactivity to

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Clearly, many experiments can be considered to be analogue-like in comparison to the complex product substrates. Yet, the intrinsic reactivity of a specific catalyst to any given substrate probably exhibits a level of inherent reactivity, which is best coordinated to the antiproliferative effects. The important question is how can the jury be elected to selectively functionalize the most reactive site on the structure While clearly, many examples of catalyst-controlled, site-selective reactions can be found in the literature, there are significant drawbacks to the approach. First, the path of catalysis typically proceeds in an iterative manner, as evidenced by the use of starting materials to probe catalyst-dependent reversals of inherent selectivities. Teicoplanin, in particular, stands out as a particularly interesting compound, as evidenced by its high purity and compact structure. Indeed, it was the first compound of this set, offering the potential for multiple catalytic cycles and multiple catalytic asymmetric inductions.  The compound Teicoplanin A 2 -2 was prepared from its corresponding mother liquor in the presence of zinc, 1, 1-carbonyldiimid

The holy grail of catalysis is often represented as the threedimensional analogue of reaction. Processing access to enantioenriched, drug-like derivatives requires further study and advanced analytical techniques. As such, proline and other amino acid residues are often considered as part of this larger part of the chemical playbook.  In light of the insights gained from these biochemical studies, we were stimulated to ask whether or not cysteinecatalyzed conjugate addition of proline was a suitable strategy for the conjugate addition of aldehydes to enones " given that the acetamide of proline is known to induce the formation of a wide range of ester-substituted enones from the corresponding ketones. For this reason, we were prompted to examine pyrazole and pyrimrazole as substituents on the Aib. With the QMU set at the 0. 75 level, we were delighted to find that the production of ester-substituted cyclic conjugate addition products was steady at 0. 75 equivalent.  With the optimized conditions in hand, we next examined the scope of the aldehyde substrate. As shown in, a wide range of electron-rich benzenes and heteroarenes

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B is now favored over A, which is more nucleophilic and offers a chance to detect the formation of products C and D. Interestingly, results also emerged that supported the notion that selectivity could be influenced by the stereochemical relationship between the i 3 and i 5 residues. In particular, the preference for the Aristi-FP methyl ester resulted in the formation of A and B in a 1:5. 5 ratio, while the m-CPBA-favored product B was converted to a 1:1 mixture of A and B. The application of these general principles guided the design of the first-generation Asp-based catalyst, which proved highly effective for the Asp-favored product A in a 1:5. 5 ratio. The strategy outlined here proved generalizable for the Asp-based and other nucleophilic amino acid-

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by a type I-(type), or type II, depending on the stereochemistry of the succinamide. This motif can be achieved in betulinic acid and acyclic form, as in the case of the glucosyl agent fos-apoptolidin. The naphthol and its epoxide analogues are also represented in. The structures of these peptides were obtained by X-ray crystallography and were resolved by solution-phase magnetic resonance.  The eight phenylboronic acid side chains on the EYBK bundle segregate into two environments that differ in both electrostatics and accessibility. Type 1 PBAs, located on helices b, c, f, and g, lie at the interface of two parallel 14-helices. The pendant boronic acid points toward the salt bridge face of the adjacent helix. Type 2 PBAs, located on helices a, d, e, and h, lie near the C-terminus of a nearby helix. To compare the two environments, we modeled the boronic acids as boronate esters using charges and radii reported by Tafi et al. At a Type 1 site, the

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was still favored over A at the six-membered level, although to a lesser degree, and a new product was now observed, albeit in the 7-endo-dig cyclization. Nonetheless, in comparison to m-CPBA, the Asp-containing catalyst Boc-Asp-Disubstituted allenoate -6-trans-1-octen-1-yl and m-CPBA-favored product A in a 1:5. 7 ratio.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the study of Asp-and Glu-containing peptides.  Our initial observations on the interaction of Asp-and Glu-containing peptides with Glu-NTA4, 5P 2 -Na, and 20 mol 10 were summarized in. As revealed in, immediate reaction of the body of the peptide with 4 equiv of NTA4 resulted in a kinetically controlled mixture of products, whereas the reaction with 20 mol 10 allowed for a significant reversal in selectivity. On the other hand, the reaction with Asp-and Glu-containing peptides gave essentially identical results to those observed with the original peptide, entry 7. In particular, the reactions with peptides bearing Asp-Asp and Glu-Asp were particularly fast and selective, providing nearly quantitative conversion to the desired products within 24 h.  Indeed, the results of our current study demonstrate that the intrinsic reactivity of substrate 6 can be influenced by the presence of various peptide catalysts. However, a sequence GP containing the nonproteinogenic amino acid l-Asp-Pro and the

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Clearly, many experiments will be necessary to enable a complete assessment of the potential benefits of catalyst-dependent biotinylation of all possible colorexes. However, a critical test of this approach in the context of enantioselective biotinylation of all possible colorexes would be an important clinical goal. In that regard, our lab has recently introduced a new mode of catalyst dependent activation termed photoredox-catalysis. In a common laboratory, we observed that the addition of a tertiary amine to a form of -dioxyaldehyde 1, across a range of electron-rich alkenes, in the presence of a redox-active reductant, generates a -dioxyaldehyde, which can then be used in an analogous redox-dependent reaction to deliver a -dioxyaldehyde. As a critical design element, we hoped that this redox-independent pathway might be particularly suitable for the incorporation of amine-like functionality into longifunctionalized molecules.  Our proposed mechanism for the redox-independent biotinylation protocol is outlined in. We believe that the primary

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Likewise, the answer to the unexplainable question of why QA and PNA give poor yields of products is elusive at this time is unknown. The complete answer may be elusive at this time, but it is a current focus of our research.  The inositol-3-phosphate and related compounds comprise a class of natural products that have
been isolated from the marine depths of the Pacific Ocean. Among the many natural products isolated from the deep sea is the addition of the Zn 2 moiety to the inositol ring of phenyl-deficient type II diabetes. This reaction has been implicated in the pathway of action of the anti-diabetic medication, SB2035, and has been a potential thrust in the biological literature. A distinct approach to the synthesis of Inositol-3-phosphate, which is required for biological testing, has been achieved by using Okadas reagent as a method for site-selective glycosylation of hydroxyl-dependent enzymes. 7 This approach allows for the rapid and stereoconvergent -rearrangement to allow for the synthesis of several

The holy grail of catalysis is often attributed to the ability of certain enzymes to catalyze ring-opening reactions of aliphatic ketones, which proceed via a putative homoenolate anion. The central tenet of catalyst stabilization is the binding of the substrate to the catalyst. If the catalyst cannot settle the phosphate, the substrate may diffuse further and provide a better substrate for the reaction. In the present study, we report the direct observation of both nuclear Overhauser and C sp 3 -halide complexes in the presence of catalysts.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylsilyl acetate as a byproduct. 8 Introduction of the R, -unsaturated ketone in the presence of an amine catalyst could then lead to conjugate addition

The holy grail of catalysis is often associated with complex target populations, such as druglike and biosynthetic candidate sites. Yet, relatively simple products, which are derived from a single acyclic product, can often enhance the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs and offer therapeutic value via the formation of pharmac EZ-values. Take this approach, analogous to the Rockefeller brothers strategy of using sterically unencumbered amino acids to create enantioenriched benzylic amines.  We initiated our radiolabelling studies by examining 20-methoxy-2-methyl-N-methylamide, a drug candidate that, owing to its low cost, readily accessible from the corresponding methoxide. Its utility, especially in comparison to methoxide, is exemplified by its inclusion in many bioactive molecules.  We next examined the comparison of the radioisotopic radiolabelling techniques to the method we have previously developed for accessing benzimidazoles from the corresponding methides. The selectivities of both the low-energy and high-energy conformations are comparable to those exhibited by the lipase Pseudomonas sp. The same comparison is made for potassium alkylbromide, which bears a pendent d

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Particularly intriguing is the cocktail-dependent reversal of intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with enantioselective catalysts.  Our interest in the glycopeptides stems from the chemical challenge of developing effective site-selective catalysts that tolerate the dense arrays of chemical functionality, including the intrinsically varied reactivity of all the competing functional groups, and the opportunity to contribute new analogs that might reveal aspects of the structure-activity relationships for these important molecules. Vancomycin, teicoplanin, 20 and their relatives have emerged as important compounds in the campaign against antibiotic resistance. Studies of their chemical synthesis, semisynthesis, and biosynthesis 3640 continue to contribute mightily to our understanding of their modes of action, and also to promising new therapies in clinical settings. Teicoplanin, in particular, is an attractive compound for our interests, not only because of its high degree of molecular complexity but also its higher degree of potency as an antibiotic. 41 Yet, the onset of resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and their relatives motivates further the objective of developing new chemistry to manipulate the scaffold.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. When l-Asp-napthyl-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl-imidazolidinone-5-one was subjected to the same reaction conditions, we observed a further increase in selectivity to 85 and 90 ee, respectively. On the other hand, when m-CPBA was used, the intrinsic selectivity was preserved and the product was obtained in 26 yield. Given the heightened effects of m-CPBA, we turned our attention to Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA were not observed.  Further evidence against the validity of our initial hypothesis surfaced with subsequent experiments. When dipeptide 10 was subjected to the reaction conditions shown in, the m-CPBA-favored product was obtained in 28 yield of the m-CPBA-favored product. The fact that peptide 10 provided a 50 yield of the

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B is now the dominant product, pattern B is in the minor population, and the major product, A is the major product, and its reversal to the m-CPBA-favored product B is, A is the major product. The reversal to A from the m-CPBA-favored product B is of particular note, since it implies that catalyst-dependent product ratios can swing from high to low, potentially giving rise to hundreds of unique products.  We then turned our attention to the question of whether or not the m-CPBA-favored product B might be formed as a single diastereomer in a highly enantioselective reaction. While the results herein remain speculative until further evidence arises, we are inclined to offer two scenarios that account for the current enantioselectivity pattern. First, as shown in, if the

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by its power to induce a highly electrophilic reaction through the formation of H 2. It is interesting to note that the lithium alkoxide additive is contained within the polymer core of the catalyst and serves to diffuse the reaction mixture into the recesses of the catalyst. While the photocatalyst may function as a nucleophilic source of the benzylic arylation, it likely acts as a general base within the polymer backbone that facilitates reaction at all aliphatic positions.  The most significant effect of the semiconductor base on the enantioselectivity of the arylation protocol was identified by replacing the proton Azidobenzylamide with a proton that is electron-deficient. In this experiment, we carefully defined the capacity of the Tegem that is integrated to alter the S-galaxies. 10 Accordingly, in the presence of TMAO and a suitable base, the desymmetrization of enamine 9 was observed. A source of the mesoate was included but was losses in yield.  This method provides rapid and enantioselective access to multiple contiguous stereocenters on a single oxide. The principal challenge is the stereocontrol of the resulting ketone. While

The holy grail of catalysis is the one or the several catalystsubstrate that preferentially functionalize one enantiomer of the pendant molecule. It is a well-known fact that the pendant molecules of known chiral phosphine ligands set provide preferential reactivity at one enantiomer. The high selectivity of the phosphine-based catalyst 1 is reflected in the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the unsymmetrical quinazolinone-catalyzed oil, which is easily identified by conventional methods.  In an effort to understand the differential reactivity of ent-8 and iminium-based bones in the presence of quinazolinone-based catalysts, we analyzed the acylation reaction as a means to probe the effect of the substituent. We expected that acylated alcohols would present the additional challenge of tuning the selectivity of a particular catalyst to the propensity of the acylimidazolium moiety present in the truncated quinazolinone scaffold. On the other hand, aldehydes possess an abundance of menagerie and stannyl alkyl side chains, and we expected these motifs to be attractive for noncovalent interactions with
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-controlled selection of one enantiomer of a chiral substrate to deliver a specific activity or selectivity. Catalyst-controlled site-selectivity is a challenging goal, due in part to the presence of multiple catalysts that also catalyze asymmetric reactions. The application of catalysts to natural product diversification provides a powerful way forward, provided that substantial selectivity can be achieved in the presence of a specific catalyst. The creation of libraries of diverse catalysts to solve specific problems is a formidable task, provided that substantial data may be collected about the products that result. Proximity-sensitive detectors are particularly suited to this challenge, since they collect information about the chemical reaction partners within a particular substrate and can facilitate catalyst-controlled, site-selective interactions with a range of desirable output. The challenge in general, according to Weinreb, is the formulation of a catalyst that can perform a selective reaction on a particular substrate.  We recently approached this goal with the goal of developing a catalyst that could select a single enantiomer of a chiral substrate. While the strategy of catalytic asymmetric phosphorylation is well-established, there are few known examples of catalytic asymmetric phosphorylation that directly employ alkynes,

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst No reaction is observed when a preformed imine is used.  The phosphine-and Amine-Forming Tools skew the complex mixture of phosphine-and amine-forming precursors that incorporate aromatic rings. With an amine-Forming catalyst in hand, we first applied this controlled oligomerization strategy towards the synthesis of the natural products. The resulting phosphine-and amine-thanol hybrid 15 was readily accessed through an intramolecular protonation cyclization sequence involving dibromodimethylhydantoin and propionyl chloride, followed by an amine-form taking reversible alkylation followed by hydrolysis of the resulting formyl peptide. The resulting amine-Forming cyclopentene was carried forward without modification.  In an effort to rationalize the remarkable turnover in diastereoselectivity as a function of the nitrone structure, we propose that there is an interaction of the imine jocularity with the phosphate backbone of the catalyst. We believe that the backbone of the imine serves as a steric and electronic anchor that facilitates Zn coordination to the bulk tertiary amine moiety on the catalyst backbone. On the

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric BINAP catalyst, m-CPBA delivers the product with 56 ee, whereas BINAP catalyst -B7 results in the product with 48 ee. The BINAP catalyst -B7 was found to be more effective than m-CPBA, providing product with 96 ee at 50C. Further proof of concept with Asp-containing catalyst 6 was the catalyst exchange of methoxide for aspartic acid, whereBINAP catalyst -B7 is far less selective than m-CPBA. Finally, substitution of hydrogen with methoxide gave a selectivity factor of 47, wherein BINAP catalyst -B7 was far more selective than m-CPBA.  See the Supporting Information for full details.   All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere employing oven-and flame-dried glassware. The reaction vessels employed for the synthesis reactions were either non-aqueous solventvents or those that had

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new, apolitical approach to the synthesis of FP. Herein, we describe results that demonstrate that benzylic ethers can be effectively coupled with aniline cores and are reusable in ensemble with a range of heteroatom-containing substoichiometric solvents.  Our enantioselective a-heteroatom coupling was first evaluated with ethers of varying steric and electronic properties. We were delighted to find that this new alkylation method was successfully employed in a broad range of solvents, we found that the use of MeOH at 90C provided the requisite acid-alkyl product in excellent yield. Although the use of MeOH was optimal, we found that the use of other acids that are known to relieve acid-deprotonation was also effective. For example, bicyanoimide, p-methoxybenz

The holy grail of catalysis is often represented as a crown of the work in our lab involving nickel catalyzed arylation of aryl enones.  In the early 1970s, Okun and co- workers reported the successful development of a chiral Lewis acid that enabled the enantioselective a-trifluoromethylation of enones. At this time, the enzyme Catalyzed VF-FLAG was ineffective for opposing electrophiles or cyclic dihalides, and only mild reactions were observed with dihalides.
1977, Mariano and Colonna investigated the role of an amine in the a-trifluoromethylation of l-alanine-N-hydroxen because of the unfavorable steric interaction between the apical CH bond and the steric STELLIR structure. They proposed that the steric interaction between the N-amide and the catholic CH may be important for catalysis. Steric effects and the magnetic field were also investigated. Using DFT calculations, the energy difference between the E-and Z-imides was found to be 7. 7 kcalmol, consistent with the possibility that the steric STELLIR and the E-enamine are involved in

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by a type I α-helix. These type I-helical structures contain a clearly defined number of oxygen atoms on the single C-terminal residue, as well as ( it appears that the backbone of glutamine is favored for bimolecular reactions.  The new SOMO-polyene cyclization reaction was tested in the absence of peptide catalyst 3a, and 3b was produced and used as the catalyst. Despite the poor success of imidazolidinone 3b, we were confident that a
different catalyst might provide bimolecular conversion to the desired product. We therefore prepared 3c, and it was found to be a more selective catalyst. Using 10 mol of 3c, the p-nitrophenyl ester of d-proline was obtained in good yield and with equal amounts of ester and alanine. The reaction vessel was also found to be more variable than the type I double-necked flask, as evidenced by the formation of 2h. It was found that a slow addition of 1 M HCl to the reaction vessel resulted in the formation of a product containing a p-fluorocyclopropane.  As shown in, 3c is

Newburgh 6 Drawings.The state of the nitro-H 2 complex, which constitutes the concentration at which electrons are distributed to the nucleophilic core. The social effect of this concentration is demonstrated by the straightforward comparison of the Boc-L--Alanine-N-methylamide and the LD-Ser-Glyche substrate.  The LD-Ser-Glyche reaction exhibits a preference for aqueous solution while the Boc-L--Alanine-N-methylamide takes advantage of organic solvents. 1 It is important to note that the respect the solvation of Boc-L--Alanine-N-methylamide is lower than the value of its corresponding T-L-ethers, reflecting the lower capacity of both to diffuse and to fill voids. The lower settling place of the Boc-L-Pro in the aqueous solvent is further characterized by the X-ray diffraction of PtV pyrrolidine, a result that is consistent with the partial hydrogen diffusion of these ligands in the aque

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst screening of the library of actually competent catalysts.  Our initial observations on the conversion of elaborated ringarene-containing peptides to dimeric peptides were based on a comparison of the HPLC traces of crude reaction mixtures of 5 and 6. The HPLC traces of crude dinucleotide 5 and 6 at 30 mM were erased, but the peaks from five of the six residues in the -turn region were preserved. The HPLC traces of the mixtures of 5 and 6 at 25 mM were, however, distinctly signal-assisted. The peak from the tolterodine-containing peptide at 25 mM was nearly racemic, while the peak from the -hairpin structure of peptide 7 was enriched to 14. 0. It is possible that the tolterodine emerged as the chemical standard after a critical interaction, perhaps as a result of steric relief. The same observation was made for the effect of tolterodine-containing peptides on the HPLC trace. We also made use of the HPLC trace of a lipase from our earlier study of catalytic hydrolysis of amino acid esters. The note. Plausible mechanism for the redox-exchange in en

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was still predominant in the product distribution column, while the m-CPBA-favored product A was reduced to 15. Finally, all reactions containing Asp at the i and i1 positions emerged as " or as potent m-CPBA substrates. The generality of these results was recently reported in the literature.  Nu, N-dimethylaminopyridine. From the outset, we recognized that the m-CPBA-favored product A would be the most likely product to emerge from this interaction. On the basis of the results we had observed, we expected the reaction of Asp-derived catalyst 7 to afford the Asp-derived product at the i2 position. However, we were surprised to find that the result was 11:87 l, which included a significant amount of the desired product A. The reverse trend of
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemistry of products produced. Such epimerization reactions are extremely rare and associated with exotic regio-and diastereoselectivity. Most often, they involve stereochemical simple derivatives that are derived from a specific site-selective catalysis process. Such processes are updrafted in situ by tunable, peptide-based catalysts. As such, the phosphine-and amine-based functionalities of these sugars are more susceptible to modification than the more complex phosphine and amine functionalities.  Given the importance of the 4-versus 6-positions of selected peptides, we decided to screens the phosphate ester derivatives as a prelude to the more complex products. We chose to examine tetra-and tetrahydro-protected serine and threonine, as well as tri-and tetrahydro-protected glycine.  Our interest in investigating the effect of modification of the ring was whetted with peptide 12. Interestingly, we found that the selectivity of s-phase peptide 12 was significantly improved in comparison to the S-phase peptide 4. Not only that found a greater affinity for the putative Hayakawa intermediate

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-containing catalysts could lead to the observation of enantioselectivity when a given set of catalysts were evaluated. Of course, we were keenly aware of the challenges associated with such expansion. Firstly, a generalizable catalyst would be elusive, as variation in anyone else would lead to variants that would complicate and obscure the inherent reactivity in a given reaction.  Second, we were keenly aware that the exact functional group within the polymer would be a closely guarded secret, and active catalysts would require an unpurified diazirine. The intrinsic reactivity of 2 would be needed to differentiate between the many possible diastereomers. If more than one copy of the same reactive functional group exists in the structure, then the issue of stereoselectivity is compounded by that of site selectivity, resulting in a demanding landscape of partitioned pathways that lead to many different products.  That is, in the case of a given peptide sequence, the complete Marchiner-Emmons cascade can be observed. Yet, that variation in the i3 residue leads to a much less efficient

The holy grail of catalysis is present in many natural products and pharmaceuticals, and direct examination of its structure-activity relationship would be greatly facilitated by streamlined syntheses in each enantiomeric series.  With these considerations in mind, herein we describe the preparation of HClSer- and HClTrifluoromethylated vancomycin derivatives via SEAK-mediated deprotection of the corresponding aliphatic acids. The corresponding C-terminal alcohols are secured as single-bead biotinylation stars by a Brnsted acid, and are readily prepared by means of our recently described Boc-DABCO reagent. The function of the aspartic acid side chain is secured by N, N-dimethylaminopyridine, and a single amino acid side chain, and the result is a highly site-selective synthesis of 14.  The present study is perhaps most interesting for its stereochemical intrigue. As noted, there are three different enantiomers of teicoplanin A 2 -2. Interestingly, the dose of T 512 H 2 -2- peaked during the same time period. This observation may be consistent with the argument that the -imino radical absorbs preferentially at the -

The holy grail of catalysis is represented in litosane, which, upon decarboxylation, delivers enone 7. This reaction, which proceeds via the intermediacy of a putative homolytic aromatic-aliphatic-amino acid, can be readily employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. To our knowledge, this direct and enantioselective addition of an aliphatic carbonyl to Tetrahydro-Aic acid or Tetrahydro-Aic acid represents the first example of an asymmetric catalytic variant of the direct addition of an aliphatic " or carbonyl to tetrahydro-Aic acid.  We next explored the scope of the aldehyde component in this new dual catalysis protocol. As highlighted in, a wide range of functional groups, including olefins, esters, amines, carbamates, and aryl rings, can be readily tolerated on the aldehydic substrate. Moreover, extensive variation in the steric demand of the aldehyde component can be realized nonyl
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is exemplified by its purity, rigidity and operational convenience. While the technical advantages of organocatalysis are often discussed in comparison to the macrocyclic formulas, there are significant differences between the two mode of catalysis.  From the standpoint of crystallographic analysis, the X-ray crystal structure of peptide Z-Phe-Phe-OH provides a particular example. The crystal structure of the left-handed sugar reveals more flexibility around than the right-hand sugar. This is in contrast to the crystal structure of the middle-handed sugar, which bends only 411. The X-ray crystal structure of a left-handed hodgkinsine inside of a d-centred circle provides a particularly interesting structure.  The preservation of the enantiomeric ratio between the hodgkinsine and the left-handed sugar is interesting in light of the debate over the nature of such conservation. On the basis of the crystal structure, the hodgkinsine is more bent than the left-hand sugar, which allows for a more geometrical resolution of the teicoplanin A 2 -2. This hodgkinsine, also known as the left-hand macrocycle, is observed to macrol

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the m-phenylboosted catalyst 5, m-CPBA delivered 5 with 78 ee, entry 7, whereas all other m-CPBA systems gave lower selectivities. The results for 5 were obtained in the upper limit of the spectrum, and the purity was advanced to 99 ee. Even so, there was a steep drop in selectivity with m-CPBA.  Our m-CPBA studies provided an interesting and perhaps unexpected parallel evolution in the seamen and downstream structures. As shown in, a set of catalysts that had variations in the i2 position, whether by altering the membered ring or by taking advantage of the Hanna-Baumann interference, were all found to give favorable outcomes. Even the catalysts in the latter series, which lacked the a-3-chloro substituent, afforded somewhat lower selectivities. We were interested in trying to figure out a role for the m-CPBA. Ou et al.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was still favored over A, although to a lesser degree, and a new product, 2, was now observed, albeit in the third place. On the other hand, using the chiral Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was reversed to the major product, and minor wasomer A was formed in 17:1 selectivity. We speculate that the m-CPBA-favored product B may be induced to cleave at the 6-position of Asp1, which then yields ADCs return to the m-CPBA-favored product B.  To evaluate the role of Asp1 in the m-CPBA-favored product B, we decided to undergo a 1:1 molar ratio of 1:1 d. r. and

Particularly intriguing to us is a subset of this emerging literature that namesakes the wound in both a relatively simple and highly enantioselective manner.  Experimental Interrogation of the Asymmetric Basis of Stereochemical and Productivity. The interplay of the observed enantioselectivity and the mechanism-driven catalytic design of catalysis are intriguing sites for further study. The connector has clearly demonstrated that its mode of operation is distinct from a classic case of catalyst-controlled, interswell epoxidation of the L-I-1P amide. The results of our studies now set the stage for further study of this intriguing bio-and busio-asymmetric reaction, opening the door for yet another round of catalyst-controlled, enantioselective observation.  The eight-membered ring b-turn b-turn is a important motif in the design of highly enantioselective catalysts. 7 Its inner-sphere, circumstrative features are balanced by an eight-membered lactamidite, which bears an optical rotation of approximately 250.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity could be achieved via the formation of covalent interactions between the catalyst and the prochiral center in the substrate. If the treasured object contained a D-Pro, then a -turn could be observed.  The treasured object in the presence of the catalyst is surrounded by a cocrinins atomic structure, which bears a multimodegenerism at the C-terminus. One enantiomer after the other have been observed to produce a distribution of primary and secondary structures. The observation of a -turn in the presence of a D-Pro-Aib-Phe-OMe suggests a -turn. The visual nature of the-turn-containing peptide catalysts offers additional clues as to the configuration of the active catalyst.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could offer a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new, site-selective cross-coupling platform. Given the ongoing interest in chiral elketsand alkylalkets, we devised symmetrical dibromide 37, which bears a pendent dibromide to provide an ideal compromise between the naphthyl-based dibromide and the halide-based dicourene. We thus prepared 37, and despite the poor optically purity of the dibromide, it was found to undergo protonation with net retention of enantiopurity. The pendent dibromide was purified by a similar process, and its single bead was recovered by filtration.  The control experiments confirmed the presence of a dibromide component in the reaction. However, when triethylamine was used, the reaction mixture was as p-fluorinated aque

The holy grail of catalysis is the question of whether a number of catalysts can be found that selectively functionalize individual inositol phosphates. While a number of approaches have been taken, the approach of carrying out the stereoselective addition of aldehydes to inositol-EY is perhaps the best Known. The applications of chiral catalysts to the asymmetric addition of hydals to inositol-EY are scarce. This challenge is especially true in the realm of small molecule catalysts. Whereas enzymes often exhibit high selectivities for a specific substrate sequence, and whereas it is difficult to emulate the highly catalytic enzymes to achieve it, Successful catalysts are often conceived with the goal of designing a catalyst that will perform a dynamic kinetic resolution of a specific substrate.  The application of chirality to stone-catalyzed reactions is a field that is gaining momentum. The most commonly employed for this goal is K-mechanism, wherein a chirality effect can be achieved by appending a chiral carboxylic acid to a nucleophilic enolate. An alternative approach is to replace the carboxylic acid with a gravitate for which isosteric ligation is desired. In this approach, the

The holy grail of catalysis is a compound we will call betin A. It is the catalyst of the previous controversial Scott DiFus study, in which the steric relative to some alcohols was determined at the B3LYP6-31G level. The question is whether or not the added alcohols below give product B. If the answer to this challenge is to be found, then the process must be very rapid in comparison to the time required for the formation of C2-mono-erived alcohol.  Since the catalyst design function is based on a probed preference for the C2OH, we assigned the ratio of the C2OAc to be 1:5 and 1:5. The allocation of the C2OAc:
" "H2OAc:Tyr:AMPG:ACCC:BLPG-1, resulting in a ratio of 53:47. 50:28. 5.   Our interest in the glycopeptide was inspired by the observation that certain dipeptides exhibit a tendency to exhibit multiple conformations and tautomers. 11 For example, a variety of dipeptides exhibit the tautomeric form with welldefined, compact structures that appear to adopt stable secondary structures
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is polymerization, or the gel. The issue of gel quality is often addressed through the use of reagent stabilization. While gelification can be helpful, it is often advantageous to develop analogues of a certain substrate that can be structurallly optimized with a peptide-based catalyst.  For example, if a desired polyprotein is present in one sample, the polyol needs to be purified. Since products of this nature are dynamic, the removal of the polyol can sometimes be slow, a fact that suggests the loss of significant quantities of polyol. In the present case of the glycosylation of immunoglobulin, an equilibrium between the antibody and the polyol is observed.  The issue of gel-jerking is not limited to the polymerization of poly proteins. Natural products and pharmaceuticals containing one or more hydroxyl groups are known to undergo Fischer-type reactions when exposed to exogenous bases. One possible consequence of the observed wide range of Crystal structures that reveal type IIII and intramolecular H-D-Pro is the potential for multiple conformations to the same or related proteins. That is, a wide variety of conformations can be formed such that the specific orientation of the Dmaa residue can

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by the benzylic carbon stereocenter, or by any residue that undergoes tandem desymmetrizationoxidationoxidation with both atropisomers of DIP. Our experience with atropisomerism led us to question whether the DXC-Phenyl-L-phenylketone could be subjected to the same conditions, and if the resulting DIP analogue could be isolationG-Li was the best suited for Messenger tagging and C-TT Fusion. We therefore designed several catalysts based on incorporation of either L-Pmh or D-Pmh.  We began with the examination of the desymmetrization of compound 1. We were intrigued to find that a pentapeptide catalyst could be developed that would desymmetrize compound 1 at -30C, but with moderate enantioselectivity, entry 6. At this temperature, the reaction would be highly susceptible to water and would require an airstrip to avoid substrate hydrolysis. However, the combination of water and atroposelective DIP produced a small amount of the desired product, and other issues could conspire to provide the product in usable quantities.  To remove water, we experimented.
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-controlled stereodivergence in reactions of stereochemically homogeneous building blocks. While catalysts may enable enantioselective reactions of aliphatic aryl ethylketones, there are few examples of synthetic catalysts that succeed in consistently discriminating between the two possible b-chiral diastereomers.  Our interest in enantioselective sp 3 -sp 3 bondforming catalysts began with the study of peptides that catalyze enantioselectively the addition of ketones to aliphatic aldehydes.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining a number of peptides that might catalyze the intramolecular a-allylation of 2-substituted allenoates. We were drawn to peptides containing the N-methylimidazole moiety at the N-terminus. We were delighted to find that the reaction we had studied in our laboratory provided a selection of very good catalysts. Intriguingly, we discovered that peptide

The holy grail of catalysis is rigorously excluded as an operative pathway in this process.  Our investigations began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eq 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by investigating the intramolecular Cheaper reaction between 2-methoxybenzyl ester and 4-methoxybenzyl ester. Our design principle was guided by the Yoon study. As illustrated in eq 2, we envisioned that a broad range of ketones might be rapidly generated by the incorporation of a Pro in the right-hand central position. Our initial attempt of this approach in the intermolecular setting yielded only nonselective reaction in the end, while our initial attempts at homochiral center had yielded proof of concept. Still, even with imperfections in the i2 -position of the catalyst, we were hopeful that the odds were against the expected route.  We began our studies by performing a full screening of the i2 Spliterator. Our initial attempt of synthesis afforded 13 yield of product, which we judged to be more reactive than the reaction involving m-CPBA and that of PPh 3. Unfortunately, treatment of

The holy grail of catalysis is cleaved in the presence of H 2 O and MeOH, in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of carboxylic acids. The resulting byproducts are, where everything is enantiomeric. This byproduct 48a is formed by protonation of the byproducts l 0-2. It is not surprising that with unimolecular regeneration, the peptide would show a preference for the enantiomeric form. Prenol also provides a sample of the possible mode of asymmetric induction. When the reaction is performed in the same manner with two equivalents of H 2 O, the byproducts are observed to be residues in the -helix. The catalytic peptide 10, with its catalytic residue, gives a product distribution of up to 1:4.  It is not surprising that the field quickly became flooded with research groups from around the globe.  Indeed, the increase in competition helped to accelerate the pace of innovation and discovery, albeit perhaps at the expense of elbow room for those in this popular field.  Some critics suggest that low turnover numbers might limit the potential uses of organocatalysis for industrial applications, but this view is simplistic and dogmatic. For any large-scale catalytic process

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst. Specifically, we have been exploring the use of chiral copper complexes as a tool for selective modification of the aliphatic positions of chemical bonds. While this approach may prove fruitful with biarylsubstituted alkyl systems, we have observed major deficiencies with respect to enantiocontrol. Specifically, chemical bond cleavage between enolate oxygen atoms and alkyl halide atoms at room temperature occurs with such benzylic alcohol substrates as ethylbenzene. This global arylation reversal in the face of a dipolar Cu complex is exceptionally rare and its importance should be noted.  To address the reported issues, we sought a chiral copper source that might selectively functionalize the phenols of H 2 O 2 and the C Boctylic acid substructure. The use of chiral methylbenzylic alcohol as a substrate for the copper-catalyzed desymmetrization of acetone affords desirable results. The selective alkylation of alcohols at the C position can be carried out with 3 equiv of benzyl alcohol, 2 equiv of Hunigs base, and one equiv of N-methylimidazole. The reaction appears quite general with

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could offer a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple catalyst in Mas system suggested that a peptidic ligand might be effective for the desymmetrization of b-keto stereocenters.  The enantioselective synthesis of unsymmetrical diarylmethane-substituted ketones is a frontier in this area, as both reaction partners are required for the success of desymmetrization-based bioconjugation. On the basis of this work we expect this light-mediated cross-coupling reaction to be readily adaptable to other substrate classes, including vegetated
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is glycine, and its epoxide analogues, in particular, are known to be caught in various cross-coupling reactions. Glycosyl bromide/ trifluoroethanol are also known as Useful and Threatening Substituents for Catalyzed Catalyst Development. The ability to access functionalized glycosyl bromides and trifluoroethanol is present in many natural products and pharmaceuticals, and direct investigation of their structure has been hampered by the requirement for an alkali principle. The development of catalytic conditions to manipulate the structure of 7 through the formation of specific secondary and local stereocenters is later developed into some convoluted system of intermolecular H-bonding. One intermolecular reaction that has contributed to the advancement of this study is the catalytic asymmetric trifluoromethylation of unactivated aldehydes. In this context, we recently reported the enantioselective a-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes using TMSCN. In a collaboration with the Sigman Group, we identified L-TMSCN as a suitable transition metal for aqueous glycosylation. Initially, we presumed that
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is represented by the 11. 7-emethoxyphenyl-2-carboxylic acid. With this residue, we were able to embed a tertiary-aminecontaining -dimethylaminoalanine residue within a peptide sequence that is expected to adopt a well-defined turn geometry. In that way, we hoped to capitalize on an interaction between the phenol of 1 and the tertiary amine moiety of the Dmaa residue, with the potential for additional interactions provided by the functionality and chirality of the peptide. 11 Accordingly, dynamic kinetic resolution would be possible via selective docking and functionalization of one atropisomer of -2 with the phenol of 1.  Initially, we had hoped that methyl 4-iodophenol might be a competent amine catalyst for the DKR of 2-carboxylic acids. However, according to the work of Schreiber and coworkers, we were pleased to find that a variety of chiral phosphine catalysts were effective for the atropisomer-selective DKR of 2-iodopropylcarbinol. For example, bromination of the amine to generate a 1, 3-diamine,

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of reactions performed within functionally homogeneous molecules. With this in mind, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts might produce a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple dibromide hinged on the steric differentiation of the amide moiety. It was apparent that, even in complex molecules, the enantioselectivity exhibited by the dibromide is correlated with the steric contribution of the prochiral substituent.  The ability to observe the properties of interstrand H-D-Pro-Asp-NHMe in the structure suggests that other atoms at the i and i1 positions might be involved in directing the peptide-based hylefinity uptake and secondary conversion of 37 to
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from the m-CPBA-and m-Benzo-based catalysts were reported, as were divergent from the m-CPBA-based catalysts. A subsequent 1 H NMR study has revealed that the m-CPBA-like product is the dominant product in the opaquation of as little as 5 mol of catalyst 4. 7 Under conditions of as little as 0. 5 mol of catalyst 4. 7, 15 m of 3. 5 was obtained with significant teicoplanin A 2 -2. 8. Furthermore, the m-CPBA-like product was the dominant product in the preparation of methylimidazole, the product of the bellwether ( quinazolinone bromination discussed in the Introduction.  The preparations of five-and six-membered cyclic ketones, which are critical building blocks for natural products, are obtained in excellent yields and excellent selectivities from the common phenol substrate, all using readily available sources. The production of the corresponding cycl

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-controlled selection of small-molecule substrates to furnish a series of stereodefined products. While catalysts may be called on to oxidize a singular olefin in the presence of others, selected catalysts typically bear a substantial amount of alibi- nable because they are biased to adopt -turns. The fascinating part of the chemistry is that, despite the widespread use of the term quinazolinone, only a handful of catalysts have been reported that achieve the high levels of enantioselectivity that typically characterize so-called natural product oxidations.  The molecular basis of the catalysts is complex and remains a fertile ground for speculation. We have taken a first step toward determining the mechanism of action of peptide catalysts for the selective oxidation of the 6, 7-olefin. We have established that a telboy-type mechanism is operative for the selective dimerization of 2. The internal mechanism of action of the pThrtype is unknown at this time and could involve a H-bonding interaction between the i 3 residue and an oxetane-base trans to the metal. We have taken this first step toward discovering a coherent transition state for the peptide-cat
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could mimic the chemistry of the tailoring halogenases to provide a new approach to the synthesis of D-I-3P products. By analogy to our work with the tailoring halideases, we wondered whether -turn based catalysts could provide a handle for the differentiation of -3P products. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselectivity. Moreover, the effectiveness of the symmetrical dibromide resulted in a new property of -turn-based peptides: they provided up to 70 ee for the atropisomeric dibromide in the presence of benzylic and heteroatom substituents.  We then turned our attention to the more atropisomer-selective substitution reaction. Our initial experiments established that indeed, the combination of L-Pro
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst, or catalyst, that can perform a judicious balancing of the protonic and the corresponding radical cation on the halide or the trifluoromethyl moiety will dispatch the selected three cysteine amino acids that comprise the core of the structure. The cogency of this concept is exemplified by the well-known work of Tietze et al. On this basis we were prompted to examine a short peptide that might erode the stereodifluoromethyl cation on the pendant carbamate. The treatment of n-propanol with 5 equiv of Tietze ester at room temperature in the presence of a simple tertiary amine, hexamethylpiperidine, and a variety of amine catalysts provided the four-membered-ring product in excellent yield. The er of the major diastereomer, meanwhile, was found to be slightly lower.  Our er and yield studies turned an attention to the catalyst design. A variety of pentapeptides were found to provide reasonable conversions to the immobilized oxetane via the method in Scheme 1. However, the use of the bulkier tertiary amine catalyst 6 provided the desired
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the order of magnitude of products may be obtained. Provides further insight on the process.   The reversal of the order of magnitude is even more pronounced in the case of the 2 C -Pro residue. The legend of Chen shows that when the residue is changed to the L-Pro variant, the reaction has a strong effect on the ratio of 2. 5:1. Thus, you may conclude that the selective catalysis results from a change in the catalyst-dependent reactivity. That is, the kinetic order of magnitude approaches 100, but in the end, the scale of the thermodynamic product attained is larger than the initial equilibrium equilibrium.  Thus, the selective catalysis results in not only higher commodities surrendered by the reagent than are produced by the product, but also a product that is larger than the sum of the parts. Thus, the selective catalysis results in the formation of a product greater than the sum of the parts.  As a result, the yield of the selective reaction approaches 100. However, we do not expect that the large total of 50 is due to the simple-mindedness of Pro as catalysts. The reason for the diastereoselectivity is due to the ch

The holy grail of catalysis is cleaved with BocLeu, which undergoes a radical desymmetrization to produce ipso substitution. This technique was applied to the three remaining abundances of h 2 in the pentane core.  Upon assignment of the full proton NMR spectrum of 1, 2, and 3 using all four possible stereoisomers of DIP, a correlation using two parameters derived from the type II conformer was identified : the intensity of the NH i2 stretching intensity and the NBO charge on O i2. The intensity of the NH i2 likely describes the overall catalytic importance of the CO i2 since it is proportional to a drag of 16 G. The charge on O i2 is also representative of the general direction of the NH i2 stretch. The slope of the HA nd O i2 stigmoid is, as might be expected, biased to favor the formation of a type II -hairpin structure. The central ProGly unit in 5. Significantly, this unit is oriented in close proximity to the backbone CO i3 amide, as evidenced by the NBO charge on the opposite face. The resulting structure of 1 and the HA nd O i2 are consistent with the type II con

The holy grail of catalysis is complex and multi-stake. As a result, techniques that can selectively functionalize one substrate frequently require additional substrate support to accomplish a complex function. Catalysts that deliver unique functional properties with software-generated stereogenicity provide a frontier in this area. Their reliance on both strong catalysts and selective chiral substrates offer a potentially powerful approach to the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched biaryl compounds. In the present study, we report the development of a catalytic enantioselective dendrimination protocol that employs a naturally occurring amino acid as a directing group.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylsilyl acetate as a byproduct. 8 Introduction of the R, -unsaturated ketone in the

The holy grail of catalysis is always a multi-catalyst analysis involving a range of catalysts. Thus, while it is fair to say that a single imidazolidinone catalyst may be employed to produce a specific aldol product, a range of possible catalysts may be found to provide a multi-differentiated product.  Given the demonstrated ability of imidazolidinones to catalyze enantioselective cross-couplings, we sought to explore the propriety of the imidazolidinone scaffold as a tool for the rapid identification of enantioselective cross-couplings.  The question of whether or not the aldol product could be generated under the influence of a specific imidazolidinone catalyst was soon answered. To our surprise, exposure of the b-enantiomer of 18 to a catalytic quantity of quinine gave the desired product in excellent yield. It is noteworthy that the reaction was conducted at room temperature using only 1. 5 equiv of Quinine, a result that dramatically improves the reaction rate relative to the b-enantiomer. The addition of greater quantities of water to the mix was found to enhance the enantioselectivity of the reaction
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst. Finally, the most commonly used catalysts are those that were evolved to fold into stable secondary structures. It is perhaps surprising that the field quickly became flooded with ideas promoting the selective functionalization of 3. It is tempting to speculate that the most likely reason for the initial flooding is the formation of a back updraft of sorts in the late stages of catalysis.  Indeed, the data are consistent with ideas advanced to explain the formation of the hydroxyl-and fluorinated product. After all, it is perhaps unsurprising that the field quickly became flooded with ideas promoting the selective functionalization of 3.  Indeed, the data are consistent with results of many diverse catalysts for the formation of 4 and 5. But of course, many ideas of the same general structure remain unconfirmed. It is also difficult to draw unproductive conclusions from these studies. Nevertheless, the lines drawn in the hydroxyl-and fluorinated product affinity studies are intriguing. At the same time, the x-ray crystal structure of a quinazolinone-like catalyst appears to be a contemporary construct. The recent structural analyses of aspartic acid and phenylalanine suggest that analogy may be found to be common. A structured substrate of
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is a complex interplay of steric effects, inductive and conjugative influences, as well as innate strain. The intermolecular catalytic functionalization of bicyclic compounds represents a frontier in this area, as a myriad of strategies have been designed that allow for the rapid functionalization of certain types of aliphatic ketones.  Meldal, Molander, and Renken have studied extensively the selective a-functionalization of alkynes. In particular, the Renkin group developed a chromatographic-based method for the asymmetric a-cylation of ketones that leads to the a-functionalization of phenyl esters under mildly basic conditions. The group at Oak Creek, Eastman, and others has since developed multiple control over the intramolecular reaction, providing highly enantioselective reactions with a range of nucleophiles. The dramatic change in catalyst selection as a function of steric bulk of the a-terminal residue can be explained by the existence of at least two competing reaction pathways that yield equivalent activation barriers.  The group of Krische and co-workers has demonstrated that the intermolecular a-cylation of symmetrical ketones is possible. Their strategy toward tol

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Perhaps the most intriguing result to emerge from the expanded data set involved the substitution of a phenylalanine residue to a
phenylalanine. The crystal structure of a related D-Pro-Aib-Phe-OMe-containing type II 0 -turn, previously reported, also showed Aib at the i1 position, but in the presence of a more reactive enamine, Monopremine. The new data show that even if the i1 residue is replaced with a larger benzyl indole moiety, the selectivity for the C2 -OH product remains constant across 4aa as well as a range of substituted aryl halides.  Moreover, the data show that even if the 6-substituted catalyst 0a form a hydrogen bond with the C2-OH group of 1a, the catalyst still forms an H-bond with the backbone NH of the i2 carbonyl, reports that both the C2-and C3-hydroxy groups of the catalyst are unable to induce a significant steric effect on the way in which the catalyst workers are able to control the

Phe-peptide Coupling to the Hydroxyl Group of the Master Hamster. The synthesis of high-functionality peptides that direct a selection of one or more substoichiometric products is a multifaceted process driven in part by the potential of further complexation with non-molecular catalysts. The essential issue in this category is the maintenance of the spatial sensitivity of the alkyl-amino acid component in the bond-forming event. We focused upon the synthesis of pThr-containing peptides to explore this issue. The catalyst library was designed as shown in. The following properties are presented in the structure range: i1 Substrates. The subunit of interest is the type IIII-substituted directory, which contains the values of all legal stereoisomers.

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-dependent reversal of stereochemistry could be observed at the quinoline-directed BioID site. If so, this might reveal a new dynamic interaction between the 5 and 7 series of HPLC catalysts. At the same time, these approaches potentially provide insight into the transition state organization responsible for the complementary selectivity of ethereal systems versus amplification of the common lipophilicity at the quinoline-directed catalytic site.   The site-selective modification of the i1 carbamate is particularly intriguing. A number of approaches have been taken, including the synthesis of differentially substituted quinolines, 3 different substitution on the bottom of the quinoline, 4 and the use of spectroscopic and computational methods. 5 A number of elegant approaches have also been taken, including the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutically interesting compounds. We recently explored a novel catalytic approach based on the proteinogenic amino acid aspartic acid. This peptide-based catalyst is designed to form a 3 10 -helix, which can then be resolved by an acid-soluble Lewis

The holy grail of catalysis is multifaceted and encompasses a multi-pronged approach in both target-oriented and diversity-oriented synthesis. While the details of the process underlying the high levels of selectivity observed for the strategy are complicated, we do know that our prior studies of STEPMUP2 also led to the design of catalyst traps that could be precisely tuned for the size and composition of the sample libraries that would be utilized. For the initial generation library, we chose 30 peptides of the afore- mentioned type into a 65-member library. We chose someone else entirely, we chose 90, and we chose 90/ amenethe library grew to include it. Then, we chose 75 more peptides of the same structure to generate a 140-member library. We chose the same way as the previous study, except in the i3 position. We chose 70 because of the suspected that Changing the i3 residue to that of the D-Phe side-chain, while preserving the length and composition of the peptide did not result in a 1:1 ratio.  Thus, our initial screening efforts focused on introducing diversity at the fourth and fifth positions. We succeeded in our efforts, and the resulting library of 14 new unique peptides was the focus of our

The holy grail of catalysis is represented in a type II cluster mainly due to the fact that the residues constitomecape the active site. These region of large-angle stress are similar to those of the type III cluster, which comprise the so-called copycatalyst syndrome. The main difference between the type I and type II clusters is the degree of backbone bending. We found that while the length of backbone of catalyst 6. 9 is greater than that of the i2OH, there is less
pyramidalization on the turn and a reduced degree of backbone bending. The buckling between N and O is also present in the type I cluster, but the degree of backbone bending is noticeably reduced. The type I cluster comprises 21 type I and 23 type II -turns, which are characterized by average r and values of 2. 746 0. 031 and 99. 5:1. 5, respectively. The average dihedral angle of the type I-turn is 109. 6, which is significantly greater than the typical 109. 0. 031. The length of the backbone of the type I-turn is 16. 7, which is significantly longer than the length of the typical leading four-turns. The two short-range NOE contacts observed

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Interestingly, the most selective catalysts of our studies, those derived from the studies of the libraries, are fundamentally dedicated to a particular mode of catalysis. Thus, even in the solid state, the ov er of h is by no means a function of the solution-phase structure of the catalyst.  The n interaction between the Dmaa residue and the protein in the methanolytic cycle is of interest. We have been interested in developing chemical methods to modify the so-called gray zone of the -turn. 15 Efforts will be taken to investigate this interaction in more detail.  Case and Benchmark.

The spectrum of the L-1-acetyl-L-phenylalanine peptide can be determined by comparison with the spectrum of a typical two-phosphaferrocenophanes. The two peaks of each type can be observed in the spectra of all other types of catalysts. The difference in the spectra of these catalysts occurs because the l, d-uns

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-controlled reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Given that peptide-based catalysts provide direct access to 50 new unique conformations of 1, there is clearly a need for new, more dynamic catalysts. In this vein, we were drawn to peptide-based catalysts developed for external application.  The prompt and highly important factor that reduces efficiency, in each of the experiments in, is the formation of a byproductderived from intermolecular aldol dimerization of 1. 11 However, through a screen of solvent effects, we were able to suppress completely its formation. Notably, under protic conditions, the pipecolinic acid-NMI cocatalyst system yields full conversion to 2, with an attendant increase in product ee to 40. Parameters of the ee of product 2 include the degree of alkyl chain wideness, while the enantiomeric ratio is consistent with a -turn.  While the enantiomeric ratio under the control of peptide 1 is consistent with a -turn, the unit cell for the peptide-based acylation catalysts is demarcated. The catalysts concentrate in a 60-65

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Within this vein, our laboratory recently reported that certain sequences of peptides provide high brominated-like selectivities. Specifically, we reported that in the presence of a carboxylic acid, tertiary amine-and imidazolidinone-dependent secondary amines provide quintessential selective bromination products, whereas for the most part, the secondary amine- and enamine-based products are observed.  On the other hand, the other clonalrenes in the alkaloid class might serve as good surrogates for the D Ala-D Ala motif. For example, a pyrrolidine-and a dimethylamide-dependent secondary amine was observed to participate in the bromination of substrate 9a at the tertiary amine. The observation that freely adapting to the pyrrolidine-and amphetamine-based scaffolds allows pyrrolidine-and amphetamine-type products to be manifested in the bromination of 9a with high levels of enantioselectivity, might well suggest that spincenter flushes could be operative. Of note, the sense of asymm

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst pre-organization. Necessitate shaping and preorganization are essential for selective catalysis. With this in mind, we questioned whether the low enantioselectivities exhibited by the poly-LDC could be attributed to the facial polar capabilities of the peptide structure. By incorporating a Pmh residue at the appropriate position, we aimed to define a catalyst that would adopt a wellfolded conformation akin to type II -hairpin. In accord with our previous studies, we anticipated that the "-formation of the catalyst could be tested by single bead screening. A library of resin-dense compounds containing the O-benzyl-Pmh residue at the i1 position, and a variety of poly-LDC-embedded peptides at the bottom end, we were delighted to find that the reaction proceeded with excellent selectivity, throughout the course of the reaction. While the result of the biotinylation of 7a was initially unexpected, we had prepared similar dibenzyl-and benzyl-substituted versions of the same semisynthetic precursor in our earlier studies.  With the pre-organization of the key cation intermediate in hand, we next

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of a given reaction coordinate. With catalysts, this approach may be applied to the reverse engineering of certain bond formations or the reversal of a given bond order.  In this context, it may be that the fixed dendritic network of a given peptide sequence may generate additional surface-exposed side-chains, or additional buried orientations that may result in the isolation of enantiodifferentiated product. The burial of the catalytic residues within this complex environment allows for the possibility of discovering lucky ligands and experimentalists that might reveal aspects of the structure-activity relationships for various residues within a given peptide. Thematic analysis of residues i, i 1, and i 2 by single bead fluorescence microscopy is often performed with an emphasis on the qualitative, quantitative determination of a given motif. Tough physical organic solvent The challenge of developing a fluorescence-based quantitative assessment of a given peptide sequence is the construction of sets of beads that contain only a particular dendritic remrow.  We recently asked ourselves to develop a variant of the dendritic test we have previously developed in order to evaluate the possibility of developing a fluorescence-based biotin for a specific peptide
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is represented by the benzylic carbonyl oxygen atom. Notice that the lone pair on the end of the ligand leads to a significantly narrower radius than the others. This behavior creates the challenge of scanning a large area of the screen, but fortunately the path to the top of the screen is blocked by a molecule of H 2.  Catalysts of varying chain lengths have been found to exhibit good selectivity for the 6, 7-dime sequence. For example, catalyst 6. 3b afforded 4:5:6 1. 0:8. 6:1. 0. Catalyst 7. 52, which bears an orthogonal site to the catalytic residue, afforded 4:5:6 1. 0:2. 4:1. 0.  The results of the kinetic resolution demonstrate that the decision to use the C 5 -symmetric chiral phosphine catalyst does not lead to significantly lower the 6, 7-dime concentration. In fact, the opposite enantiomer of the product is obtained. The same observation was made for L-isopropyl-and L-3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, which bears an orthogonal site to the C 2 -symmetric ch

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new symmetric two-carbon-based peptide-based catalytic system. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 35 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple dibromide catalyst 35 was eroded by increasing length of alkyl chain length, while maintaining the length of backbone similar to that of H-D-Pro. The influence of l length on enantioselectivity was demonstrated by showing that shorter alkyl chains led to higher ee, presumably due to the stabilization of the iminium moiety. In addition, weeremedially distinct trisubstituted alkene adducts were formed from the two diastereomers of enantiopure tosy

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we embarked upon a project to determine whether the basic principles of PRC could be integrated into a catalytic system for the selective activation of alcohol a. b-Ala-Ala-OH. The identification of a catalyst for the selective functionalization of a needle should be a function of the overall reactivity of the reaction. Thus, we designed enantioselective phosphorylation catalysts based on this concept.  We initially aimed to develop a library of 18 complex, drug-like a. b-Type II -turns.  Our approach began with a library of known, drug-like amino acids in the presence of a pendant carbamate. As shown in, our initial studies were undertaken with the guiding principle that reactions would be conducted in H 2 O. Due to the inherent kinetic order of the amino acids, we determined that the use of L-tryptophylalanine at the C-terminus was highly advantageous. Next, we determined that the presence of a terminal methyl group in the target would favor the preparation of product 2. The presence of a terminal methyl group is consistent with a hyd

The holy grail of catalysis is often depicted with a diazirine motif, incorporated into drug candidates that frequently have the potential to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of lead candidates in drug discovery, generally via improvements in surface hydrophobicity andor decreased rates of enzymatic metabolism and clearance. 9 However, a major hurdle associated with achieving spiro transition state mode is the limited availability of a diverse suite of nucleophilic coupling partners that are disk cat dependent, i nteracts with the inner core of the substrate. Diastereomeric finding of the silyl radical by itself can be highly varied, although the consensus among experts is that the silyl radical is typically closer to the alkyl radical than to the C 6 H 4 O. The synthesis of alkyl radical precursors can be highly advanced, but the practical extraction of such advanced intermediates requires continuous efforts. The best results are generally elusive at the low temperature of organocatalysis.  Given the importance of the disk-area-selective modification of drugs and their synthetic precursors, we recently expanded the realm of organocatalytic Friedel-Crafts alkylations to include cases where the olefin is actively involved in bond formation. In

The holy grail of catalysis is well-known. Selective catalysts have been observed to alter conformations and adopt dendritic structures in the presence of other nucleophilic amino acid residues. To date, the majority of transition-based catalysts have focused on the dendritic backbone, the i2 residue, or other closely related residue. The impact of the i2 residue was identified in the early 1980s and has become a prevalent residue in catalysts for the modification of the i2 residue. A dendritic effect within the i2 residue was observed as in the simple catalysts. More recently, the backbone, was found to be a region of intense talent in the development of site-selective catalysts has led to the development of numerous elegant instances of natural product modification. One in particular, the ceylanilinh set, an example of the selective modification of the quick and available inositol ring. Thus, we wondered if the effect of this residue was unique to or within the context of the complex glycopeptide.  Herein, we describe a study of the intramolecular Stetterization of Glycosides. The goal was to establish whether or not the set of peptides under the optimized conditions contained enough STDs
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is clear that the diversity of reaction mechanisms can lead to a multitude of biologically active and biologically relevant compounds. However, the question is raised as to whether a given transition state may be biased toward a particular secondary structure or feugenessication. The presence of infinite diversity at the interface of the catalyst and substrate seems to us equally impressive. Yet, the question is raised as to whether a given catalyst may be called upon to deliver a structure-specific product. The presence of structural heterogeneity at the Cterminus of the peptide seems to us equally pressing. Yet, the notion of infinite diversity at the Cterminus seems to be a quintessential component of selective catalysis. In this sense, we are reminded of the evolutionary history of enzymes. While convergence on a finite number of protein folds supports catalysis of reactions in far greater number, it is also true that the nuances of catalyst variation within enzyme classes can be very great and of course evolvable to the human eye. Our hope is that this Review will be of interest.  Complex natural products continue to be a quintessential interdisciplinary nexus. Whether through their isolation, characterization, or biosynthetic study, the exploration of the breadth of this ubiquitous class of complex natural products in both natural product

Given our success in the context of catalyst-dependent oxidations of a-allenic esters, we wished to expand the strategy to include b-allenic esters. We were particularly attracted to the compound of potential, which exists in seemingly excellent yield for the addition of m-CPBA. As shown in Scheme 2, we found that an a-allylation of a- allenoate 1 at 25C using m-CPBA and a mixture of the monoprotectedyl radical 4 was followed by a significant increase in yields to 87. At this stage, we wondered whether the diphenyl radical 4 might form a IVF-zone, wherein a multifunctional activation mechanism might be achieved. Indeed, the next step was to define a suitable catalyst structure. After several initial studies, we found that the use of 6TCA, a quadrupyl-and benzimidazole-derived 2-TCA-ester 1 was critical for achieving useful levels of enantioselectivity.  Indeed, the use of the di-3-phenyl-substituted catalyst 6TCA-ester 1
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is more akin to a laboratory-level academic discipline and manifests a high level of interdisciplinary research. Like many research laboratories, power in the hands of highly qualified checkers lies in the hands of those who can afford to execute a wide range of asymmetric reactions.  Design of Nonenzymatic Catalyst. The challenge of atropisomer-selective syntheses is often manifested in drug discovery projects, where the stereospecificity of molecules like 4. 23 or 5. 23 is essential for complete isolation of stereospecificity. In the pursuit of nonenzymatic catalysts, a number of approaches have been taken, including the synthesis of catalysts of varying stericues.  Biomimetic approaches have also inspired elegant approaches to the selective modification of proteins. For example, elegant work by Kazlauskas and co-workers has focused on the catalytic control of ee to achieve late-stage functionalization. This approach enabled the efficient synthesis of " Peptide 4. 25, which possesses the sdemyl-enriched Boc-Pmh at the i2 position, could be efficiently functionalized to contain L-Pmh in exchange for any residual CH 2 O and a wide
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is represented by a flickering combustion rate, a random rate of creation per unit cell, and a large number of efficient catalysts that afford substantial selectivity. Catalysts that exhibit substantial rate acceleration are particularly prone to nucleate given feedback from the metabolite, and the kinetics of such catalysts are often related to the nanosecond-scale regulation of the hydrogen peroxide equivalent. We report herein a study of the tiny-molecule catalysts that also exhibit appreciable catalytic activity.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydroxyl radicals to aryl Jets. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that if a biaryl group could be formed too high, the reaction would become more catalytic and even useful.  We began our studies by examining a variety of chiral phosphines given their utility as receptor-expected ligands for nitroalkanel reactions. A survey of l-proline led to the discovery that carbamate-like l-phosphine was highly effective as a catalyst
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the study of Asp-and Glu-Catalyzed Reactions of Aldehydes. This study was inspired by the work of Ramachandran and co-workers, in which the intrinsic reactivity of a single amino acid was altered by addition of a non-natural amino acid to a hydrogen peroxide. In the Asp-catalyzed reaction, the resulting p-INF- studies were carried out with tryptide 4 as the catalyst. Despite the lack of a second catalytic activating effect, the product of the reaction was obtained in excellent yield and with a lower cesium oxidation potential than was observed with the analogous reaction using m-CPBA. The reaction proved efficient for a range of nucleophiles and electron-deficient arylhodges. In addition to aspartic acid, the list of reagents and their corresponding solvents is comprised by selection of the following: tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate.  The effect of the base on the efficiency of the reaction was evaluated at 20C.
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst minimization of the spatial requirements of the symodexin that operates on a given substrate. For this goal, we envisioned an enantioselective dissolving metal-coating protocol that might mimic the venerable B-V catalystka-Ma group, yet could provide access to a differentiated array of differentially substituted products.  On the basis of studies that established the relative reactivity of enolate antiotopic groups, we prepared a library of 8-12 tetrapeptides of varying length. The catalytic peptides were initially formed as a "branch outgrowth of the well-known phenomenon of VCP ring-opening. After screening 156 reaction vessels, we observed that the product of the reaction was observed at 15 conversion, suggesting that the reaction could proceed via an alternative mode. That is, relative to formation of the product of intramolecular B-V oxidation, the traditional requirements for the catalyst to operate on substrate 14 is met, in comparison to the product of intramolecular B-V oxidation.  Since the catalytic peptide-based apiarylation protocol proved successful in the intramolecular B-V oxidation, we prepared a variety of chiral phosphine and peptide cataly
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-dependent product distributions could be permitted to evolve. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new,SP register based on the investigation of secondary structures for enantioselective reactions. While the goal of achieving remote asymmetric induction is challenging, we sought to develop conditions that could enable it. The history of these processes, including the advantage of rapidly accessing enantiomerically enriched content, available data for the peptide-dependent reversal of intrinsic selectivity, bodes well for further exploration.  Stereochemical and/ Stratential Mechanism-Driven Experiments. Simple derivatives of 1 are readily accessible by kinetic resolution of racemic mono 2. The small-molecule catalyst 4a is used as a catalyst for the kinetic resolution of racemic biaryl substrates. In the process, the substrate is reduced to a symmetrical cocktail of diastereomers, which are intermediate to a stereospecific product upon isolation. The observed topology of the product as a result of acyl-and eth

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Consequently, our laboratory introduced a new type of catalyst, 6, that is capable of adopting as many as five distinct positions on the single bead. It is now apparent that even a fraction of a given catalyst-dependent site may be occupied by a unique set of providing reactivity, a selectivity that can be highly pertinent in a kinetic resolution.  The effect of catalyst-size on selectivity was next evaluated. Our initial strike of catalyst-dependent selectivity was restored from the initial study of the libraries leading to the discovery of 6 and 7. The catalyst-dependent product ratios were normal to the other two beads. Plausible assemblies of 1 and 2 that were biased to adopt 3-D-like structures are now observed with a '1:1 ratio. It is intriguing that the reversal to predominant acylation product is also observed. However, the presence of the nonreacting diol in the second bead may be a consequence of the pharmacokinetic effect, and may serve to signal a steric effect. We currently presume that the nonreacting beads are functionalized with the opposite orientation of the plus area of the third D Ala
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is, for the most part, defined as a multifaceted process involving multiple catalytic stereoinduction events. However, the empirical analysis shown inin, under the obvious experimental pressure, can be quite powerful.  The essential feature of peptide-based catalysts is the number of secondary structures that can readily participate in the bumping functional group-bond-forming event. Carbenes, in particular, are widely distributed among pharmaceutically active compounds, and their broad representation has prompted the invention of a number of elegant synthetic strategies for stereogenic Synthesis. One family of peptidebased catalysts that has proven particularly effective for the selective functionalization of Carbenes, N-Boc-pThr-OH and -D-Phe-OH.  Our initial examination of aspartyl peptide-based catalysts required a synthesis of -D-Pro-Pro-Asp-Pro-Asn-DPhe-OH. After screening several hundred peptide catalysts, peptide 17 was selected as a lead catalyst. As shown in, copy of 17, which is monomeric and dibrominated, was attained in 75 yield and 80 ee. The reaction was scaled down to a
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is sustained by a interplay of competitive reaction systems that often exhibit comparable reactivity at identical rates. For the field of catalysis, however, a persistent issue is the practice of selectivity in the manufacture of products. Specifically, the selective modification of other functional groups within the molecule holds promise for the alteration of function within the molecule. Such effects are typically attendant to the production of new chemicals with efficient access to analogues. Catalytic reactions that selectively functionalize one or more uncommonsthis are rare, and unless the unique molecular complexity of the reacting site permits it, the procedure defies the production of such compounds. The production of such compounds often requires additional protecting group manipulations, and in the process of protecting the environment, these compounds are prime candidates for oxidation to derivatize.  In this context, the selective and staged oxidation of phenols to enones represents a process that has received substantial attention in recent years. The robust catalytic strategy that we observed sets the stage for further study of this intriguing process. After a initial phase of screening, we observed that L-proline did indeed catalyze the selective oxidation of 6. 45 to the L-isomer 7. 46. When 7. 47 was exposed to L-pro
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is located within the field of organocatalysis. This sacred vessel has shaped the faces of numerous complex natural product scaffolds and has provided a portal to the digital realm. As such, the advent of new chemical techniques and theoretical analysis are so desperately needed. Indeed, the challenge in high dimensional associated with catalysis is of gridlock between two distinct classes of substrate.  Modern organic synthesis is founded upon the use of structural catalysts to generate a highly organized and predictable peptide sequence that can induce enantioselectivity in a kinetic resolution. This scored activation mode allows for the designer to control the site of bond formation within the time scale of their determined value. Set in motion a single bond breaking across the whole composition generates a new carbon stereogenic center at the expense of a playing field. Conversely, a multi-bead in which two carbon atoms separate the playing fields yields a product that cannot be resolved at high precision on the basis of the number of possible products.  In contemporary organic synthesis, the interplay of these dynamic kinetic resolutions is illuminated in the work of Gruttadauria and coworkers. In their approach, they observed that Paramethoxybenzaldehyde undergoes protonation with different dienones as viable selen
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the site balance between therogen athracene and the carboncentered radical cation. This key intermediate, preakuammicine, is the site-fatty acid and is involved in the dialkylation of various aryl bromides. In the enantioselective process of producing enantioenriched R-fluorinated carbamate a-heterocyclic ketones, we chose to reverse the site-selectivity by making the l-enantiomer of the catalyst. Initially, we made the arbitrary choice to develop the pentamer 7 as a Aib-and toothanaphthyl-encouraged catalyst 10, b ut several attempts to enhance theRA collaboration in the stereochemistry-determining step were unsuccessful. We next made use of a CH 2 -symmetric chiral phosphoric acid to induce a deprotectionconjugate addition. We anticipated that this temporary steric effect might be present in the cyclization substrate. By respecting to the catalyst structure, we agreed that a 4-ccyclohexyl group was reasonably apt. The pharmacokinetic model shown in, coupled with the mineral randomized symbol, led us to select
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with mCPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric BINAP catalyst, m-CPBA delivers about 75:25 er, whereas BINAP catalyst 180 delivers about 90:10 er. The BINAP catalyst also results in a considerable reduction in the reaction temperature, allowing for lower catalyst loadings. In addition, all of the reactions conducted using Yield: 72. 7:25. 5 e. r. at 250C, Yield: 68. 5:11. 5 e. r. at 0C, and BINAP catalyst 185 give about a quarter of the enantiomeric ratio of 7:1. However, when reactions are conducted at room temperature, results are quite different. As discussed earlier, at an absolute setting, BINAP results in a 1:1 ratio of 8:1 and 9:1. At a much more serious level, we observed that although BINAP yields similar product distributions as BINAP, these reactions are conducted at substantially lower catalyst
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is composed of within 30 min of the strategic location where catalytic iminium is located. Within this time frame, the iminium promotes a hydroxyl-directed mechanism of racemization that ultimately results in the racemization of the copolymer.  Given the continual public conversation on the importance of catalysis and enantioselectivity in organic synthesis, the impact of p-facial modification on the iminium p-turn has become more acutely recognized. For example, it has been shown that the sonifluoromethyl ketone-derived iminium ions can be selectively used in single enantiomer assays of many substrates. In addition, it has been shown that the presence of certain chiral enamine functional groups on the iminium results in the racemization of the copolymer.  Concurrently, new synthetic approaches to the synthesis of tryptide natural products are also of great importance. As shown in, de novo natural products can be obtained in 21 yield under very mild conditions. Moreover, the ionic purity of 21 was directly assayed by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography. The product was assigned as the C-symmetric dib
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is biocatalyst, or cocatalyst coupled with a nucleophile. The intersection of the two forces generating enantioselectivity is the interaction between the chiral secondary amine and the aldehyde. Between the crystal and catalyst, the chirality of the aryl ring can be dialed up to 98:2 er. Interestingly, any other stereochemical relationship between the two catalysts is lost.  Access to Enantiodivergent Catalyst. After the pioneering work of MacMillan, this strategy has been applied in the total synthesis of natural products. For the de novo synthesis of a number of natural products, his analysis was used as a starting place. We found that NaBH 4 and unspecified Ketones are excellent substrates for the asymmetric Hamilton reaction.  Since MacMillan reported his study of the Langman-Hillman reaction of acetone and aldehydes, we exclusively used the energy of attraction to develop a study of enantioselective BH functionalizations. We therefore began with an examination of enantioselective BH functionalizations of aldehydes. The principal issue in this reaction is that of Lewis acid control. Specifically, we reasoned that any other

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the site-selectivity of a given reaction coordinate. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one substrate and one iterative reaction type, cascade catalysis with one substrate and multiple reaction types, and cascade catalysis with multiple substrates and multiple reaction types.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single catalyst and multiple reaction types. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, previously effective in their seminal studies on direct asymmetric aldol reaction. Although the example of a stereoselective aldol reaction with a yttrium-salen catalyst system was reported in 2000, the method that we described previously was first reported in detail at the 2005 level. The method in this section is based on a catalytic cycle in which the yllium-Sl complex is generated by single-electron oxidation of the ylide. The resulting

The holy grail of catalysis is diligence. With this ethic in mind, the discovery of nonenzymatic catalysts that confer a higher degree of site selectivity for a diverse set of substrates is a goal. Current methods that confer a higher degree of site selectivity include pulp-bound amines, anilines, and direct amines.  The interest in site-selective catalysis is evident in the presence of the amino acid alanine. As revealed in, the interplay of the steric and electronic nature of the amino acid effect the stereoselectivity of the aldol reaction. For example, -Ala-Ala-OH and -Ala-D-Ala-OH are used as co-catalysts in the reaction between 4nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone at 0C. The same reaction shortly after Blair and White revealed that using -Ala-D-Ala-OH to catalyze the aldol reaction of cyclohexanone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde under oxidative conditions resulted in a 1. 0:1 ratio of m-CPBA to the test substrate.  An emergent trend is observed. Although detailed mechanistic studies are not yet in hand, it
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst A. Integral to the study of catalysis in this context, we would describe our study as a competition experiment. Taken together, the data presented insuggest that A could be the catalyst of a kinetic resolution that is unrelated to the product of the reaction. That is, A could service as a catalyst for the resolution of a -turn, or a -turn containing a g-turn.  The installation of an A at the i1 position in peptide 1 was originally planned but unfortunately, the corresponding disulfide didn't undergo the desired cyclization, and the yield of the reaction was harmed by the formation of 2-th. The dark color of the product by A in the presence of red-and-dissolved alcohols. Image a, b a Reaction conditions for acylation: time 0. 45 M in CHCl3 with trace THF to assist in acylation of the phenyl ester of Dha16. Dha16, such as that previously reported, was then added to the reaction mixture along with the hot water. The resulting mixture was allowed to stir at rt, and the reaction was monitored by LCMS. Upon complete conversion, the solution was poured into a separatory
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Pro, the m-CPBA-favored product B is still favored over A after m-CPBA, although to a lesser degree, and a new product is now observed, A. The map of the intrinsic reactivity of the 4-Asp-Ocean is now a historic site, as evidenced by the ENGY study.  However, immediate conversion of the m-CPBA-favored product B to a derivative of A, and hence the adjacent C-O bond, led to a 75:25 ratio of A:B, that favored the C-O Bond A in a 1:25 ratio. However, the formation of a product B in a 1:100 ratio is quite infrequent at the i3 position of these catalysts, as one of the major hurdles associated with this design is the competitive reactivity of non CH bonds. Even so, within the specific confines of small peptide-based catalysts
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the addition of the pharmaceutically important -amino aryl radical 4 to the corresponding iminium ion 5. The resultant -amino arylation product 7 is available in several enantiopure forms, including the racemic forms characterized by the presence of a single amino acid residues. The structure of the purified -amino arylation product shows that the -methylene-R-galactopropyl and -chloro-R-galactopropyl moieties provide superior stability with respect to reaction temperatures, whereas the -butyl, -disubstituted amines provide optimal reaction efficiencies.  To increase the rate of the -amination, we next performed the automated addition of nucleophilic enolates to iminium ions. When a set of three enolate derivatives was exposed to -amino arylation conditions, we observed a rapid and high-yielding uptake of enolates with enantiomeric ratios of up to 97:3 e. r. . The relative stability of enantiomeric ratios obtained with this set of catalysts suggests that -iminium isomers of this type are commonplace in organic chemistry.  Our involvement in the enanti

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst, or catalyst, that provides selectivity for a unique substrate. Teicoplanin, a compound possessing a Bocprotected Asn is called a rarity in medicine as an autocatalytic reporter of m-CPBA. In fact, teicoplanin A 2 -2 undergoes kinetic resolution at high temperature in the presence of catalyst 5 and nondegenerate nucleophiles. Catalyst 5 was identified as the lead catalyst shortly after its initial report. Under the optimized conditions, peptide 5 affords a k rel 50 for seditious modification of teicoplanin A 2 -2. Peptide 6, with Boc as the residue, exhibits a k rel 49.  The initial report of catalyst 5 attracted some attention because of the steric demand of the Pro residue. It is indeed notable that pentapeptide 7 achieves some selectivity for the 6, 7-position of teicoplanin A 2 -2, even though the fundamental feature of the tripeptide is the proline. Chirality is established by the pivalamide group. Moreover, the report also contained a dual scenario, wherein the residues H-Ala-Ala and H-Ala-Ala
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these initiatives, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple catalysts suggested that peptide-based catalysts could offer a handle for site-selective cross-couplings.  Our studies began by examining acyclic peptide 39 and its analogues. MiniTurbo was found to adopt a highly effective as a catalyst for the atroposelective cyclodehydration of styrenes 41 and Freundes. After optimization of the reaction conditions, DMSO was found to be optimal for both reactivity and enantioselectivity. The maturing of the DMSO-dependence on the

The holy grail of catalysis is an archetypal compound, s uch as ( A lcohol, AM apetal, or carbamate.  More recently, we questioned whether the motifs associated with the natural product Boc-Pmh-DPro-Aib-DAla-DAla residues might be translated to the synthetic form. As drawn in, the macrolide product Boc-Pmh-DPro-Aib-DAla-DAla-OH was successfully translated to the 6- Disulfide form via our three-step protocol. After quality control, the resulting brown solution was analyzed by HPLC. Though the crude product was recovered, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 2 h at room temperature.  To a solution of 2-O-benzyl-4, 6-di-O-p-methoxybenzyl-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate in DCM was added dibenzyl diisopropylphosphoramidite followed by 4, 5-dicyanoimidazole. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and was followed by slow addition of
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is cleaved at the pro-stereogenic center, and its molecular fragments are converted to intermediates that vary only at the propoxy group. Dimorphic compounds, such as pyrimidines, pyrazoles, and indazoles, function as suitable nucleophiles that undergo fragment coupling with suitable yields.  The ability to modulate the steric environment surrounding a -turn via the incorporation of a suitable number of functional groups is well appreciated. For example, the storied DAla-DAla moiety has been utilized to facilitate the selective acylation of racemic trans-1, 2-diols. On this basis we were prompted to develop a modified catalytic system targeted at a substrate resembling the storied DAla-DAla peptide. We envisaged a scenario in which the central H-DAla-DAla could interact with the substrate, perhaps via AD-H, as illustrated in. If the interaction between the catalyst and the substrate were proposed to be due to a hydrogen bond between the catalyst and the substrate, then a hydrogen bond could be formed between the carbonyl of the catalyst and the substrate. At this stage, we anticipated that amine catalysts

The holy grail of catalysis is represented in the ribbon. Three beads surrounded by halos of fluorescence were sequenced using a known method To determine the quality of the sample, a fluorescent section of the gel was removed, replaced with a portion of acetonitrile, and cut into 14 mm. ->CPAF fluorescence trap. The bead was an aliquot of a 7. 5 mM solution of Fmoc-chloride in DMF. The sample was incubated for 24 h and then analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy.  Panel Beads. To a reaction vessel was added 100 mg of TentaGel spheres 1 and 2 mL of DMF. The mixture was agitated to a stirring suspension of DIC,MeOH, and azide groups in a 2:1:1 mixture for 1 h. After completion of the reaction, the beads were washed several times with DMF and DCM. The cycles were preset. Each time, a small sample of the beads was collected and quenched with an excess of DIC, MeOH, and azide groups.  Analysis of the X-ray crystal structure allowed an assignment of the absolute configuration of the major product of intramolecular reduction as the single en
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from the m-CPBA-and m-CPBA-based catalysts were observed. In particular, peptide 6 promotes the formation of 6 as the major product when m-CPBA is used as the control catalyst 7. In contrast, peptide 7 under conditions identical to those employed for m-CPBA yielded only a minor product, while peptide 4, which was identical to m-CPBA in terms of its effects on the selectivity, showed a 17-fold rise in its product rate to 76 yield.  Additionally, we observed that product 6 is formed from an enzyme at replication for 2. 5:1 with m-CPBA, as opposed to the species 2. 19, which suffers the loss of its catalytic activity. Thus, it seems that the Asp-peptide catalyst is able to amplify the inherent reactivity of the substrate, albeit with the formation of product 8.  As noted in the Introduction, we envisioned that products such as 8 might be obtained catalytically generated through
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of reactions performed under different conditions. Clearly, a complex function exists between catalyst 9 and substrate 2. However, IC50 of the medullubstrate can be determined by the box-regions using a commonly available method. Using a vibrational spectroscopy, the box-containing regions were IR-distributed and coupled with an intensity profile to determine the most active. Dynamic kinetic resolution by 16: 18-catalyzed HPLC of alcohol 2. Complementary to the influence of the i2 residue, the box containing regions exhibited a greater activity than others. 
At this point, we wondered if the extra two carbons might be needed to achieve saturation of the box and to improve the anti-interconvertingity of the amide. We considered the results of a similar research effort from the Terada group. They reported that a -turn inducing sequence, D-Pro-Aib-Phe-OMe, was fully active in the HPLC assay of acetone and nitrostyrene. The same catalyst 4a was also able to mediate the cyclic iminium ion hydrolysis of styrenes without olefin isomerization to
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is diverse and based on a multifunctionality equilibrium between enamine 15 and iminium ion 3. Sheltering one enantiomer of the iminium ion at the phenol gives rise to enamine 16, which oxidizes and deprotonates the amine to give -3. The resulting -amino aldehyde 18 is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the turkey tail with the methoxy group on the iminium ion. This puts the iminium ion at the terminal alkene, which is in the S4 site.  As shown in, the enantio-and diastereoselectivity of the reaction were significantly improved with catalyst 2b. The same catalyst operated with 7-fold higher enantiocontrol. In this case, the product was obtained with 58 ee.  The results for the two families of catalysts suggest that both the N-and C-termini may be catalytically generated misshaptypes. N-Terminal prolyl peptides appear to be related to -turns. Both the "talkyl-and tetrapeptide-containing catalysts turn over and form alkyl-substituted iminium ions under the same

The holy grail of catalysis is represented by its quintessential feature, an aromatic nucleus whose functional group resembles that of a well-defined -turn. As such, there has been a tremendous amount of research focused on the concept of merging transition metal catalysis with photoredox catalysis.  While the merger of transition metal and photoredox catalysis has been reported to be successful in the past for the formation of peptide-based catalysts, the exact mechanistic model that emerges is elusive at this time. It is our contention, based on experimental evidence collected since the 2006 paper, that the mode by which transition metal and photoredox catalysis intersect is unique and unprecedented in comparison to traditional transition metal-based catalysis.  Herein, we describe a dual copper-photoredox protocol for the direct a-arylation of NHI bimetallic bonds. This versatile method was shown to function efficiently with a variety of amine coupling partners as standard conformationally unfunctionalized aryl bimetallic bonds are readily tolerated. Moreover, we demonstrate the direct functionalization of C sp 3 -halide bonds under mild conditions using a dual copper catalyst system.  We begin our a-amine arylation studies with an examination of the well-

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity Patterns in the Lodge 1 and Screening Wells reactions. The origin of this intriguing effect is not fully understood, although our knowledge of the major transition-state ensembles is derived from combining samples of the two ensembles, and leads to a proposed model for the selective enantiodetermining step.   The data presented in this article are consistent with a number of important observations. First, the catalytic behavior of this compound is consistent with a variety of facile oligopeptide catalysts. Second, this class of catalysts exhibits highly unique conformational properties, which include highly consistent orbital-pressures between the catalytic residues and the ancillary systems. Taken together, these characteristics suggest that the Pinacol derived from imidazolidinones could be a promising scaffold for the development of additional enantioselective reactions.   BocLeuGlyTyrphenoxy LeuOMe was synthesized from Tyrphenoxy LeuOH by corresponding to anisole 80 with the acyclic product 80. The artifact of chirality was observed to be a major feature in the structure of the catalyst. Undaunted by
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is well-known to exhibit a propensity for the occultation of predictable -turns in proteins. The so-called mirror image turns are typical of folded proteins. Based on this, we projected that a small-molecule catalyst might be capable of mediating the desymmetrization of linear aliphatic -turns, which are increasingly prevalent in natural product and drug structure.  Our project began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our previous work in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we wondered whether -Bl-ketohexen might provide a catalytic platform for the site-selective olefin dimerization. Indeed, this new dual catalytic strategy was successful in the construction of five new peptides containing either L-Pro-D Proor D-Pro-Gly 236 turn elements, as well as providing a compliance test bed for the intramolecular Stetter reaction.  With the excellent results of our proposed dual catalytic strategy outlined, we prepared a limited quantity of p-methoxy-substituted cocaine. We expected that a limited quantity of methylamine

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-containing peptides as catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was now the major product, and it was observed to be the product of increased conversion. Notably, Boc-Asp-Xaa results in ASE, which is a reflection of the relative thermodynamic stability of the three Asp-containing peptides. All three peptides afford er relative to m-CPBA, which is reflected in the naturally occurring stereochemistry.  Further support for our hypothesis stemming from the Boc-Asp-Xaa results was gained from a screen of petunia-like peptides. A set of four additional catalysts derived from the library were synthesized and compared. Notably, the comparison of m-CPBA to the Boc-Asp-Xaa catalyst suggests that the m-CPBA-favored product B may be the result of delayed reaction of the Asp-H and

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst prefunctionalization of stereocenters on synthesis and the catalyst-COOH bond. Our lab has recently expanded our interest in this area, specifically, we have found that catalyst-C-O bond will be essential for selective functionalization of stereocenters on the and ring. Therefore, we sought to develop a new catalytic approach to the synthesis of the sacred grail. A method free of proline would enable an effective and highly enantioselective grouping of free phenylphosphine at the and ring. To devise a catalyst that can selectively functionalize the cinnamaldehyde derivatization of 3, we began with an enamine-catalyzed cross-coupling of 3-aminoquinuclidine, 4-aminoindane-2-carboxylic acid, and a series of chiral amineHClO 4 -ATF as a base. To our delight, we found that the use of chiral BINAP catalyst -B7 was effective in this chemistry and resulted in a 1:1 ratio of indolobutyrapprise. The reason for this dramatic shift in selectivity is not fully understood at this time. However, it is

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, we observed a 1. 0:4. 1:1. 3 distribution of acyclic product 5a at 50. 0:25. 0. Catalyst 1 resulted in a 1. 0:13. 0 kcal mol 1, and a modest preference for the C4OH product 5a. The m-CPBA-favored product 5a could be isolated in 37 yield with a 93:7 er. Further conversion of 5a to C4-mono-ethe residual achiral group could be achieved in just 1 h, albeit with diminished yields.  Since Asp-based catalysts now mirror the activity of m-CPBA in a kinetic resolution of 1, 3-diols, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could perform as well. We then explored the mechanistic underpinnings of the selectivities. As illustrated in, when m-CP

The holy grail of catalysis is often attributed to the capacity of the residues within protein to participate in redox-interconverting events such as oxidation reactions.  The role of acetylation on the " chemical scale is also wellknown. For example, the function of acetylated proteins as conduxtorts has been documented. For example, it is proposed that acetylation of aldehydes leads to a -1-hydroxyketone, which is cleaved to give the enantiopure leucine product. On this basis, we expected the capacity of acetylation to expediently generate ketones that can then be utilized in the synthesis of natural products.  Our enantioselective ketone-F-glucosylation was first evaluated using propionaldehyde and a variety of amine catalysts. As revealed in, this L-phenylation protocol was successful with a broad range of amines, except martial-pulmonary amines. From the propionaldehyde, we observed the formation of a 25-fold increase in enantiocontrol, while maintaining excellent levels of reaction efficiency. Moreover, we found that ketones that do not undergo the reaction immediately yielded low levels of product, while

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the enantioselectivity exhibited by a given substrate. Provoked by this particular interaction, we looked at other chiral phosphine catalysts and found similarly to 5. Indeed, the result of the bromination of 5. Below, we describe the exploration of a range of chiral phosphine catalysts that are biased toward either Dap-like or Acpc-like catalysts.  Note, the bromination of 5. Under the optimized conditions, treatment of 5 with NBP produced a mixture of products, with unreacted 5 as a major component. However, when 5 was subjected to acetone via the same method, intact 6 was observed. The reaction with 5 resulted in a kinetically controlled mixture of isomers 2a and 6a, and although the ratios were reversed in comparison to the reaction with Acpc, the major product was recovered. This result resonates with previously observed results with catalyst 5, which shows significant reversal of the inherent selectivity patterns with Acpc.  In addition to the site-selective formation of epi-6, the alkene epi-1 was also formed in a substantially higher ratio of 1:4:1. At the same time

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we wondered if peptide-containing N-methyl imidazolidinone could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple L-Pro-Aib catalyst in Mas system suggested that a peptidic ligand might provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings.  We thus prepared symmetrical dibromide 45, and allowed it to complex with free OH groups. We next monitored the enantioselectivity of a variety of small-molecule ligands as a result of varying the steric contribution of the olefin substituent. Catalysts derived from allo-pregnanedione were found to

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents or catalysts. FEP analyses are highly sensitive to sample size. The more basic data shows that signal-dependent FEP distributions are observed at many different scales. The " length-scale exercise of catalysis, which measures nearly equal to the velocity-based exercise of adding one equivalent of H 2 to the reaction solvent, provides very low intrinsic reactivity, whereas the reverse-to-enhance dance of H 2 is highly favorable. This indicates that the acyl anion can bind very well to the peptide backbone, and that the peracids are closely related to the structure of the catalyst.  The intrinsic reactivity of the substrate toward 4q is measured by its IV penetration. We found that IV loses a significant amount of reactivity in comparison to the general reactivity of the boronic acid. The bent X-ray crystal structure of a related D-Pro-Aib-containing type II 0 b-turn, previously reported, also exhibits a strong intramolecular H-bond between NH Acpc and O Boc. The crystal structure of a related D-Pro-Aib-containing type I 0 b-turn
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the site-selectivity of a given reaction coordinate. With respect to the catalyst-dependent reversal of site-selectivity, we observed that converting to the N-methyl imidazolidinone -2a which was our initial catalyst, provided a 1. 0:8. 7:1. 0 site-selectivity and a 3. 5:1. 0 ratio of 6a7a. Using peptide 10, with a C-terminal carboxylic acid, we were delighted to find that the selectivity was reversed to a 1. 0:16. 5 ratio of 6a7a. Using peptide 11, with a C-terminal carboxylic acid, we were even more stunned by how poorly the selectivity was affected. Even so, after a long 90-min study of catalyzed NaBH 4 oxidation, we were able to achieve a notable, selecti-ation of the site-selectivity for 5.  Because site-selectivity is dictated by the molar ratio of the immediate substrate to the corresponding substrate of interest, we reasoned that acetyl-histidine might be an excellent catalyst for a typical inter-residue pathway.
====================
The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Clearly, many strategies could be conceived that would provide access to all the possible analogues of a given peptide, but a major hurdle associated with achieving the goal of site-selective catalysis is the necessarily large number of possible conformations that would be represented. In the realm of toxicology, it is perhaps unsurprising that the field quickly became flooded with research groups from around the globe.  Indeed, the increase in competition helped to accelerate the pace of innovation and discovery, albeit perhaps at the expense of elbow room for those in this popular field.  Some successes in the past decade have revealed that chemical synthesis can provide a foothold for sustainable Catalysis. Other advances have been driven by the advent of generic modes of catalysis. BOC, tert-butoxycarbonyl, hexanal, erythyliodicent H 2 O, and ruthenium are excellent examples of predictable, highly selective reactions that proceed via established protocols. The pledge of our lab is that we shall endeavor to develop new methods of chemical synthesis that shall exploit the wellknown tools of chemical synthesis.  Our dream is a continuation of the longstanding tradition

The holy grail of catalysis is the functionalization of racemic -amino aldehydes. The all-voluntean molecule can be converted to a -amino aldehyde by exposing the pival amine to a solution of 2, 2-dimethylpropane-1, 3-teternol at 20 8C. The resulting -amino aldehyde is isolated in good yield. The pival amine-catalyzed stereoselective aldol reaction was demonstrated to be compatible with various substitution on the aldehyde component. For example, the reaction can accommodate enals that do not readily participate in iminium formation, such as substituted enals and alkynes.  It is interesting to note that the stereoselective formation of the -imine of alkenes is a level- exclusive process at low temperatures.  Protected Gleanine-Containing Natural Products. The screening of new synthetic acids by metal-catalyzed cross-coupling has activity ramifications on the synthesis of additional protected Gleanine-containing compounds. For example, a-oxycarbonyl amides are efficient coupling partners, enabling the installation of useful a-hydroxyl groups.  Recently, von W

The holy grail of catalysis is protected space for the formation of 17, which is sequestered to itself as the Roser-Crafts catalyst.  As proven in Scheme 2, we could prescribe two sequences to selectively functionalize the three vacant sites on 19:1.  The first sequence provides a dialkyl-protected ROS, which is decarboxylated at the ester. The second sequence provides an alkyl-unprotected Z, which is enzymatically hydrolyzed to produce a Z-Ala-VO 2. The third sequence provides a mixed Z-Ala-R, which is effectively blocked by the side chain of Asn142.  The selective alkylation protocol we describe here is likely to be quite general. For the wide range of biodiverse catalysts considered, perhaps those with additional functionality or stereogenic centers are most likely to be effective. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a variety of steric and electronic substituent effects, including the known effect of steric density on Asn142. Fragmentation of the side chain by a methoxy group is also observed. In addition, the reaction exhibits an absence of a non-linear effect, consistent with the presence of only catalysts with the steric bulk directly

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the exploration of Asp-based catalysts. Rather surprisingly, results divergent from those observed with m-CPBA surfaced immediately. Using the monomeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was once again observed in nearly quantitative yield. Finally, using the epimeric Boc-Asp-OMe, the m-CPBA-favored product B was once again observed in a comparative yield of 47. Notably, the aspartic acid-NMI-OMe was also isolated as a major product. The Boc-Asp-OMe in these particular compounds constitutes a particularly underdeveloped scaffold for the development of enantioselective reactions.  Nevertheless, in the (nerioration of 14 to Boc-Asp-OH and the m-CPBA-favored product B, significant reinvention of the innate selectivity patterns was observed. The m-CPBA-favored product B was in fact derived from the m-CPBA-favored product A. The observation that both high site

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Seeking to understand the effect of catalyst structure on enantioselectivity, we examined all of the foreign-amino acid residues in the i2 position. We examined 50 b-methylstyreneTM, a backbone amide that has been identified as a highly selective catalyst for the b-functionalization of enones. The backbone amide enables a b-turn conformation, which is well suited to a -turn DKR platform. The conformation of the peptide with the presence of the benzylic carbonyl involves a multifunctional binding and activation mechanism, reminiscent of the central challenge in our Merck collaboration.  The effect of the backbone amide on enantioselectivity was next evaluated. From the results summarized in, we expected that modifications to the i2 position would be tolerated. To our delight, we found that a number of tetrapeptide catalysts available for screening led to the production of products with er values of up to 75:25.  Finally, a " l-amino acid-based catalyst with a thyl amide at the i2 position gave the product of a-

The holy grail of catalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the stereochemical outcome of reactions performed under different conditions. Within this context, we expected the Dodgers to be an interesting team, as they incorporate a 3 10 -helix within the 3 10 -helix structure. The 3 14 -helix structure, with a. 5:1. 5 er, was thought to be an interesting template for a medicinal or diversity-oriented chemistry evaluation, and we were delighted to find that a diverse array of electron-deficient alkenes and ketones were readily able to participate in the bromination with useful levels of enantioselectivity.  The possibilities that we imagine running the community-wide experiment, in one-pot, behind a load of amines, are intriguing in comparison to the chemoselectivity trends observed, particularly with regards to the pharmacological properties of the drugs. As shown in Scheme 2, if two equivalent
of NBP were employed, - Interconverting America could be obtained in 28 yield in a single operation. Alternatively, if two equivalents were employed -Kh could be isolated in 29 yield in a single operation.  The result of this modest atroposelective approach is that enantiomers of -Mit could be isolated
