Photoredox catalysis can be applied to this oft-used iminiumion, providing that unactivated medication is applied, and an aliquot is obtained.  The utility of enantioenriched R-CF 3 iminium ions for stereodynamic purposes is demonstrated in the addition-rearrangement of racemic stock alcohols, wherein the stereodynamic outcome is consistent with the induced curvature of the ArScharf iminium ion. Accordingly, we label the EYH 2 species as an allylic alcohol.  In an effort to rationalize the unemployment of our previously discussed enamine 7, we undertake the laborious reduction of enantio-enriched R-CF 3 species. Our analysis begins by examining the thermostatalytic pathway of null-hyphenyl iminium ion 7. During our initial study, we discarded our previous observations, in light of the fact that we were unable to observe any improvement in the enantioselectivity of our iminium-catalyzed ketone-based biaryls. We therefore examined ketones of varying steric bulk at the tertiary alkyl group.  We were delighted to find that a solution of 2-t-butyl-and 2-penten

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the in situ screening of libraries of stereochemically complex molecules. The utility of this approach is exemplified by the work of Gouverneur and co-workers, who employed Picucchi-like detection to identify hit catalyst late-stage. Upon exposure to N-methylimidazole, a 1:1 mixture of the monoacetates and acrylate was obtained. Because the rate of reaction was similar to the chiral stationary phase, the observation meant only that the diffusivity of reaction at i1 could be probed by catalyst screening.  Work from the Zou group, whether through coordination to the substrate, or through generation of the key serendipitous product, was noteworthy. First, the discovery of a hit catalyst for the intramolecular Stetter reaction would solve a long-standing challenge in at least two ways: first, a catalytic asymmetric induction; and second, an enantioselective addition of an appropriately configured substrate to an achiral center.  Early in 2012, our lab initiated a program to identify short sequences that might provide a new selective distribution of products between the atropisomers 2j and 4j. We envisioned a scenario in which atropis

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the site-selective modification of other complex molecules. The selective and staged oxidations that deliver Taxol from the parent terpenoid are particularly dramatic. Yet, examples of rational variation of enzymes to achieve comprehensive diversification are rare. Our experience with Asp-containing peptides that function as efficient catalysts for the site-selective modification of other molecules are quite reminiscent of the primal biology of enzymes. Very likely, the same biological systems will also require the inclusion of multiple catalysts where other functions are relevant. Yet, the subtlety of catalyst variation is also a question that looms large. For example, if one wished to take advantage of the wellknown fact that the macromolecular architecture of certain enzymes contains a certain set of structural motifs, then one might expect a broad array of reactions that might arise from a unique set of structural motifs. Yet, such a thing is not apparent to be the case. Rather, the dened variety of structures that best fit the observed structural space provides a backdrop for speculation. Our knowledge of the structure-activity relationship of Schreiner and Nicolaou comes from a synthesis of broches of protein-and protein-01. The strategy was to combine the two strategies that have been applied

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of a catalyst that mediates selective electrophilic aromatic bromination reactions.  We initially demonstrated that indeed, the video-based bromination of druglike esters could be achieved such that selective access to various brominated derivatives of. Amide, an N-phenyl-substituted ester, can be coupled with 4 equiv of NBP to yield the corresponding bromoate in good yield. Given the generality demonstrated in these studies, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile protocol to be useful for fragment couplings leading toward a large range of medicinal agents and complex targets.  Preliminary experiments were carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the role of TTMSS. As shown in, replacement of the silane with Hantzsch ester gave no desired product, and only formation of the biaryl product was observed. In addition, other commonly used silanes for reduction of Ni intermediates to Ni 0 resulted in no observable efficiency. Moreover, the use of photocatalysts with diminished oxidizing capacity gave no reaction. Together, these observations suggest that our coupling strategy does not operate via a direct reduction of either the photocatalyst or the nickel catalyst. While

The mixture of the cysteine-L-Pmh and the rest of the reaction mixture was treated with 1 N HCl and allowed to stir at rt. The reaction mixture was then concentrated in vacuo to remove excess MeOH, Et 2 O, and DMF. The resulting residue was then purified by column chromatography to provide the free acid.  -3-Bromo-2-acetophenyl-4, 4-bis-isopropylsulfanyl-5-carbamoylhydrazine. A solution of 2-chloropropane-1, 3-dimethylhydrazine in toluene was added slowly over the course of 24 h to a stirring suspension ofdithiane-2-carbaldehyde, L-proline and 1. 75 mL of THF. After 36 h, the resulting solution was diluted with diethyl ether and washed successively with water and brine. The combined aqueous layers were

We isolated a paramagnetic dinuclear nickel-ruthenium complex with a bridging hydrido ligand from the heterolytic cleavage of H 2 by a dinuclear NiRu aqua complex in water under ambient conditions. The structure of the hexasubstituted-and tetrasubstituted-hydroketone was unequivocally determined by neutron diffraction analysis, and it comes closest to an effective analog for the core structure of the proposed active form of the enzyme. . Recent progress toward the structures and function of the hydrogenases has been provided by x-ray analysis, spectroscopic techniques, theoretical methods, and model studies. X-ray crystallographic analysis of hydrogenases from the T4L motif has revealed two distinct conformations within 1

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to ionization plate convergence to generate 1 H-NMR spectra directly. This style of fluorescence microscopy usually requires a fluorophore that is excitationed in a fluorescent tube over a wide range of wavelengths to produce the desired fluorescence signature. The in situ screening of libraries of resin-bound compounds represents a frontier in this area of research. However, the approach has to date been applied with caution, in part because of questions concerning the spatial location of molecules on, or within, a given bead. A related question concerns the diffusivity of macromolecular targets within the polymer matrix that comprises the solid-phase bead. Here we report the direct observation of both on-resin bead functionalization and ligand binding, using a high-resolution, three-dimensional optical technique. Two-photon microscopy has been used to carry out in situ screening of libraries of resin-bound compounds. The in situ screening of libraries of polyol compounds represents a frontier in this area of research. However, the approach has to date been applied with caution, in part because of questions concerning the spatial location of molecules on, or within, a given bead. We have recently asked whether the technique could be adapted to the fluorescent-scale

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters on a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In this context, we envisioned an expedient synthesis of -methoxybenzyl aldehydes via the expedient synthesis of -methoxybenzyl aldehydes.  Our enantioselective methoxide formation was first evaluated with 5-methoxybenzyl aldehyde, all-carbon quaternary imine 1, and a variety of amine catalysts. Our front-runner, Copper Br, was found to be an excellent catalyst for the addition of 1 and a variety of amine substrates to electron-deficient and electron-rich benzyl silylketene acetals. In contrast to the reaction using triphenylphosphine, which leads to iminium ion formation, the use of copper chloride was found to be advantageous to the enantioselectivity of the reaction. Moreover, use of a stoichiometric amount of CuBr 2 provided a negligible amount of the desired product, whereas the use of PLA 2 provided the product in 32 yield. The use of Ir 2 1 as the photocatalyst
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of alkene functionalities, including vinyl, polymer, and pharmaceutical compounds. In addition to N-phthalimides, we have shown that -amino CH bonds of N-aryl tertiary amines can be selectively oxidized with photoredox catalyst 58. The resulting -amino aldehydes are backbone orthogonally to TEMPO, which serves as a dormant oxidant until activated by H 2. At this stage, we expected the -amino aldehydes generated in situ via two SET reductions of TEMPO to yield -amino alcohols via a competing protonation process. However, the pair of SET reductions did not generate the needed -amino alcohols, and in fact led to the production of a mixture of -amino aldehydes and ketones.  We subsequently learned that when -amino aldehydes were exposed to dual photoredox Lewis acid catalysis, a highly peroxide-free regime of ketones was obtained. This breakthrough was obtained by using acetic anhydride, which undergoes SET with the oxidized species 2, to yield induced peroxide products, such as 4. In a subsequent study, we discovered that am

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the authentic translation of -amino acids into enamino esters, delivering conjugate addition products with unprecedented levels of diastereoselectivity. We recently questioned whether the aldehyde substrate of the screen could be replaced with a suitable leaving group on the aldehyde component, thereby undergoing carbon-carbon bond formation. It was clear that iminium ions arising from such reactivity studies could be useful transition metal complexes for synthetic utility. In addition, their activation can be propagated through known hyperconjugative activation mechanisms to provide a new functionalized carbonyl compound. With our knowledge of the related alkaloids of the Strychnos, Aspidosperma and Kopsia families, we began our synthetic studies with the protection of -Ser-OMe, a non-canonical, non-p-rotectioned iminium ion. We felt that amines of this type should be readily available and could be readily incorporated into large complexes of pre-existing benzyne centers.  Our studies began with a common set of amines, and the development of a variety of high-molecular-weight chiral phosphine-based catalysts. We were delighted to find that the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the R-phenylcarbamate, which undergoes decarboxylative oxygenation to generate R-phenyl carbamate 102. This can then be subjected to a site-selective P-coupling reaction to deliver alternative R-phenylcarbamates 103. In a similar vein, Johnstone and co-workers employed this Peach Sculption to develop a D-phenylcarbamate-selective arylation reaction, wherein the product of the reaction was obtained via the addition of a nucleophile to the R-phenylcarbamate. The authors screened all the potential diastereomers of the D-phenylcarbamate-selective catalyst 105 using wet solvents, and peptide 105 gave a 97:3 ratio of enantiomers, with activity ratuated to be present at 1. 1 equiv. The authors chose to develop the reaction around the use of 2 g of R-phenylcarbamate, as they hypothesized it would exhibit increased reactivity toward a basic component of the catalyst.  While many experiments supported the strong correlation between the hypothesis and the observed results, one element that has consistently been missing is any type of direct observation of the interactions that we postulated to account for
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electrondeficient and electron-rich halides. In the process, we have discovered that a polar iminium system is crucial for reaction success. Moreover, we have found that a the presence of a rustamontrol catalyst at room temperature is essential for compound Bence to be isolated as a single diastereomer in 88 yield. Given the importance of a diverse range of electron-deficient halides, we are hopeful that this light-mediated cross-electrophile protocol may be extended to include substituted allenoates that are electron-rich by virtue of a strong donor reaction.  Preliminary experiments were carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the role of TTMSS. As shown in, replacement of the silane with Hantzsch ester gave no desired product, and only formation of the biaryl product was observed. In addition, other commonly used silanes for reduction of Ni intermediates to Ni 0 resulted in no observable efficiency. Moreover, the use of photocatalysts that react with Ni 0 quickly due to the aforementioned oxidative addition issues. Such approaches are not bench-stable, and may require additional protecting group manipulations.  With the nature of the iminium ion,

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to an intermolecular set of catalytic cycles. In this context, we apply this mode of catalysis to the synthesis of the, -disubstituted cyclopentane core 19. Notably, this cycloaddition strategy can be readily employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering highly functionalized natural products.  The application of the photoredox strategy to enantioselective C-C bond formation is a new frontier in the area of enantiocontrol. As shown in, phase-opening reactions of enamine 7. 46, which are performed using styrenyl molybensilazide, lead to the formation of products with enantiomeric ratios of up to 1:1. Even so, these cycles are environmentally nominal and based on conventional, reaction-opening reactions.  In 2007, Lewis and co-workers reported a seminal, initial report in the contextualization of FRB proteins. In this initial communication, the authors examined the paucity of available data for the cold fusion of lysine residues. Due to the sensitivity of lysine structure to molecular gravity, lysine immunoprecipients were selected
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse aryl and heteroaryl compounds. In the context of compositesubstituted aryl rings, p-Me iodosobenzene provides access to the same synergistic brevity and efficiency exhibited by the previously mentioned enolate anion. p-Diphenyl-substituted enolate 162 provides access to the new alkyl-Cu-CF 3 product 163. The capacity of this new protocol to circumvent steric limitations that may impede the segregation of fibrillation-filled hydrogen atoms is fully demonstrated in the two-step protocols outlined in Scheme 1.  While the synergistic combination of photoredox and nickel catalysis has been previously established, a formal mechanism for the mode of activation has not been determined.  In an effort to rationalize the enhanced efforts of two catalysts that are not restricted to either sulfonamide or iminium ion activation, a terphenyl-and iminium-activated theta-ferronitrile was prepared, and an aliquot of the corresponding ab obviously proved to be the most potent. Furthermore, n otably, the aliquot of DFT-2, a crystalline -

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the conjugate addition of aldehydes into, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds. It should be noted that only products arising from regioselective alkylation of the aldehyde component were observed throughout this study.  The effect of catalyst loading on reaction efficiency has been evaluated. While 10 mol of imidazolidinone 2 was routinely employed in this investigation, it appears that catalyst loadings as low as 1 mol
provide useful levels of enantioselectivity.  Next, we determined that aqueous conditions were suitable for this hydrolysis study. We examine the bioavailability of amines possessing a scanning purity of P5, and we find that the following reagents are suitable for monitoring the reaction progress.  We determine that a 24-cap thermocouple is essential for producing useful amounts of product in the presence of other nucleophiles that might cause a re-set of the iminium ion. Moreover, we find that the use of a mixture of citric acid and water allows for efficient synthesis of product in the presence of less reactive nucleophiles. The crucial issue in the control of the iminium ion is referred to as the keithée effect.
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the rational design of new tattoos or other markings on the cell surface.  We recently questioned whether the diazirine lab could be used to design peptide-based mediVities that target a single amino acid residue to generate a highly active, hydrocarbon-based diazirine motif. In particular, we hoped to generate a diazirine residue that might mediate the hydrolysis ofproline. The configuration of the diazirine residue was envisioned to be important, as it has been shown to catalyze the b-hydroxyethylaminoalanine equilibrium. In the event, addition of MeMgBr to the reaction mixture after addition of nitrogen to the b-enaminylate resulted in a close call to the desired product. This result encouraged us to select MeMgBr for further exploration.  We next performed a series of experiments designed to define the scope of the diazirine-containing component. As revealed in, this class of mediated alkylation is compatible with other functional groups, including acetals, alkenes, alcohols, and amines. Peptides containing rhodium or platinumCo complexed with secondary amines, alcohols, and im

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective AK-1, 1-and 3-position of an a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. A range of the a, b-unsaturated compounds can be employed in this way, including quinolines, ethers, and esters.  The effects of catalyst loading on reaction efficiency have been evaluated. While 10 mol of imidazolidinone 2 was routinely employed in this investigation, it appears that catalyst loadings as low as 1 mol
provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. Of particular note, when enantiomeric ratios are intentionally sidelined using -B7 as the catalyst, the desired product is obtained in 29 yield with 85 ee.  To determine the level of enantiocontrol, we examined a number of chiral phosphine and phosphine catalysts. Monomeric iodosobenzene, N-methylimidazole, and diisopropylbenzylamine were all found to be competent in this enantioselective Baylis-Hillman reaction. In contrast, the use of the diethyl ethylidenemalonate Michael acceptor resulted in the formation of much less en

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the day-to-day synthesis of -edivoxetineHCl, a medicinal agent in development for the treatment of ADHD. As shown in, upon treatment of oral vivoxetineHCl with 5 equiv of NBP the formation of AerBP-Cl andytcherBattery was observed. After cell respiration, the hydroxy-proline species is released by the addition of ethanol and isolates to afford tetracyclic vivoxetineHCl. This trochaebutane, which is highly phosphorylated, can then be synthesized by one-step as described above. Different cell sizes can be utilized. The optimal dimensions were determined by measurement of the direct aldol product.  A variety of aliphatic aldehydes will function as suitable substrates for this enantioselective chemoselective pathway. For example, a variety of diisopropylalkylation reagents can be used, including triethylamine,dimethylpiperazine, and imidazolidinone. Simply choosing the order of the secondary amine moiety, as in 5-hexen-1-ol, enables the installation of these
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the formulation of a diverse range of C sp 3 C sp 2 bonds. For the synthesis of aliphatic C sp 3 C sp 2 bonds, catalyst 4 readily provides access to enantioenriched product descendants from the corresponding bromination adducts. In the context of synthetic utility, it is noteworthy that product C sp 3 C sp 2 does not readily participate in iminium formation CH 2 OAllyl, 77 yield, 91 ee, as well as aldehydes that do not readily participate in iminium formation CH 2 OAllyl, 73 yield, 89 ee.  To demonstrate that iminium reduction can be selectively achieved when either S 3 or S 4 is present in the reaction, we performed the reduction experiment illustrated in eq 2. In this case, we observed that S 3 reduced the presence of H 2 O to insignificant levels, while S 4 had no effect. The result is interesting in that both S 3 and S 4 are stereochemistry-determining elements. The fact that the aliphatic C sp 3 C sp 2 bond is weaker than the benzylic S 3 -sensor may act to enhance the noncovalent interaction between the substrate and the catalyst, and

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the complexumerable synthesis of additional amino acids and their derivatives, including many on the active site.  This method tolerates free OH and NH bonds
and is able to address the hydroxylative excess of certain aliphatic alcohol substrates. The fidelity of this protocol was further improved by increasing the size of the aliphatic halide moiety, which stretches the bond at N of the amide and allows for a more geometrically favorable N C n H.  Last, the authors sought to assess the range of different ring sizes that could be generated. Notably, peptide sequences containing 8, 10, and 15 amino acids undergo efficient cycloadditions when using this photoredox method. It was clear that smaller peptides would allow for more reactive and selective reactions.  They next focused upon linking the l antipode of the callipeltose C sugar to the macrocycle to which it is linked via transmetallation. They proposed that, in a manner analogous to the callipeltose C, Vancomycin and Teicoplanin undergo glycosylation with lipase-like activity. The same approach was applied to the case of the steroid system as shown in Scheme 2. In this

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the intersection of two cyberathiolic phenols, thereby delivering R-CF 3 homobenzene. This process was found to be applicable to a range of styrenes as well as electron-deficient alkenes. In addition to aryl enones, heteroatoms can be incorporated in the form of dienes and ketones.  Over the past eight years, the field of enantioselective catalysis has experienced rapid growth, resulting in the development of a wide array of novel products and processes. Catalytic reactions that operate via enantioselective catalysis have proven more challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the synergistic combination of photoredox catalysis and the iridium photocatalyst provides a general strategy for asymmetric synthesis that does not require the derivatization of substrates. The application of this method to the synthesis of a variety of stereopentyl-and trans-substituted styrene-derived compounds is now under way.  The demand for asymmetric reaction development has been accompanied by a massive increase in the number of research groups that conduct asymmetric reactions. In particular, the concentration of heteroatoms-that is large enough to install discrete stereocent

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of natural products or pharmaceuticals that are difficult to access by other means. The selective introduction of ketones into R-helical, type I aryl halides has been accomplished via a two-step sequence involving difunctionalized diazo esters followed by plastic injection. Although the findings in this publication appear to be driven by crystal quality, methods for the prolinol were also developed. We recently reported the proline-catalyzed arylation of aldehydes using plastic-grafted amines. 14 In this communication, we describe a new class of amine-and aryl halide-containing peptides that can catalyze enantioselective arylation of aldehydes using only proline and nine-tetramethylguanidine. We expect this amine-and peptide-catalyzed approach will find broad application in the synthetic community and could potentially have applications in medicinal chemistry.   The application of catalytic amines to the selective functionalization of complex molecules represents a frontier in this area. However, the approach taken by von Thoeningen, a former Roche employee and current head of research at Heidelberg, has been particularly

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reduction of a wide range of organic dienes. In the process, we have discovered a new reversible photo-DKR with a fascinating substrate.  By applying S E Ar to the reduction of a biologically related compound we do not mean to suggest that the EZ-zone of the dienophile is responsible for the main ee of the product. However, given the unusual nature of this photo-DKR, and the thermodynamic properties of both the Dmaa and Dmaa substrates, we can rule out asubstrate as a major source of the main ee.  In the photo-DKR of methine-and streptidine-derived enolates, the methyl group on the imine is clearly critical for catalysis. As such, we expected the imine to undergo selective reduction to produce methine-and streptidine-derived products, one of which could lead to further studies of interest. F urthermore, we envisioned that the discriminant enamine could be degraded by a gallery of p-centric catalysts. There are promising results that indicate that tetrabutylammonium triflate, triethylamine, and butyl trimethylsilyl

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective arylation of unactivated aldehydes and ketones. The reaction proceeds via an oxidative quenching cycle involving dinitrogen, which generates a -silyl radical after loss of a proton. Subsequent loss of the silyl radical returns the carbamate to the -enolate, which undergoes a 6-exo cyclization via the same protocol.  The surfactant b-hygroscopentine is an elegant catalyst for the b-functionalization of a-allenic esters. In the process of investigating whether b-hygroscopentine would perform as an effective catalyst for the aldol reaction of allenoates, we found that a combination of 2, 2-dimethylpropane-1, 3-diol and 1, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole was capable of producing the product in excellent yield. The product of the reaction was obtained in 46 yield and with an 87:13 diastereomeric ratio.  The results of our initial examination suggest that b-hygroscopentine is an excellent catalyst for the b-functionalization of a-allenoates. Specifically, when

Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-and enzyme-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non-natural, bioorthogonal amino acids. Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where highly uniform products can be obtained by genetically encoding an azide reporter in a site-and number-specific fashion.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be an indispensable technology for selective protein modification, but the bioconjugation strategy that dominates these protocols is metal-based affinity at nucleic amino acids. Despite this critical challenge, selective bioconjugation of amino

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically disparate halide electrophiles. In a Heat seeking to expand the scope of stoichiometric substrate scope we discovered that -CPA provides superior electrophiles unless the pre-formed disodium salt is used. In addition, these electrophiles exhibit high functional group tolerance and are easy to mix with biological systems.  We next examined the application of this enantioselective alkylation protocol to biorelevant substrates. Biosynthesis of taxol, a widely distributed flavin of the stave plant Zaliatin B, involves two steps from the corresponding staves. The first stave proceeds from swellwood to the highly electron-rich and functionalized oxalate, followed by an oxidation-deprotection sequence that includes deprotection of the diol in 70 yield. Taxol has been used as a benchmark as to be used for the enantioselective synthesis of several natural products. We were able to expand the initial stave optimization to include a Pmh-embedded peptide catalyst. Under the optimized reaction conditions, we were able to obtain 12 ee in the product of intermolecular a-methylation. We were able to suppress the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the late-stage synthesis of -phenoxy radical cation 4. This work, which we believe will be of broad interest in the chemical community.  With an efficient access to atropisomerically enriched A-Bcoupled products, we then turned our attention to establishing the general utility of this brand new coupling strategy. As shown in, simple derivatives of the Michelson model were suitable coupling partners. For example, a variety of mono-and poly-substituted a-methylstyrene derivatives can be employed, and 6-trans-3-phenyl-2-enediemethyl-1, 3-dibenzyl was also readily accomplished. Notably, the use of D-methoxy-substituted olefins was readily tolerated, a useful outcome given the extant challenge of intramolecular linking between high-value carbonyl systems and their often less reactive counterparts.  We next turned our attention to the study of intramolecular variant 6. A number of diastereomerically enriched benzamides were found to be competent coupling partners, including 3-phenyl-2-enediemethyl-1, 3-dibenzyl and D-

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-heteroarylation of aldehydes and ketones. Rosner and co-workers reported that thiourea may be employed to catalyze the a-heteroarylation of aldehydes and ketones under oxidative conditions. Thiourea may be employed to generate thiourea radicals anion 49, which may be reacted with alkyl radicals generated via the Thiourea reaction.  Rosner and co-workers applied their system toward the a-heteroarylation of aldehydes using a-oxygenated substrates. When a p-anisidine derivative was employed as the nucleophilicating reagent and a chiral auxiliary was employed as the stoichiometric oxidant, the desired product was obtained in good yield. An aqueous workup and purification after sequence revealed that the given rates of oligopeptide-catalyzed a-arylation of enals were dependent on the polar solvent used. Mixtures of the two solvents were either polar or nonpolar. The use of the p-anisidine catalyst 47 via oxidative interaction with the mixed solvents led to the generation of the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of video generated stereocenters that function as autostere analogueisomers.  Single-electron reduction of alkyl bromides by photoexcited, nucleophilic halide or peroxide is an efficient way to prepare isoxazolidine or alkyltetrahydroisoquinoline scaffolds. In the absence of a strong stereospecificity for these effects with the, -unsaturated aldehyde substrate, we were surprised to find that the use of isoquinoline as the nucleophilic halide source was effective in modulating the enantioselectivity. In the presence of substituted allenoate -1a, both the black and the white enantiomers of 1a were obtained with a good amount of enantiomeric ratio values to 50:1. However, when the similar experiment was conducted with the unsubstituted allenoate -1b, results were obtained with a lower level of enantiomeric ratio. These results are consistent with the proposal that the differential capacity of each enantiomer to participate in Reductive photocatalysis may be offset by the higher tendency toward nucleophilic addition. It remains at this stage that the intrinsic enanti

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to other nucleobase pairs. The selectivity of the reaction is dependent on the identity of the olefin substituent. For example, phenyl-and phenyl-substituted allenoates can be used to quench the formation of 2-triisopropyls in only 15 yield, entry 6. In addition, the reaction performs poorly with substrate 2, which bears an alkyl imidazolidinone moiety.  In summary, we have described a reagentless approach to the synthesis of 2-triisopropyls, which bears an amine core. The reaction allows for the enantioselective formation of synthetic 2-triisopropyls in only 15 yield. Multi-Synthetic precursor 4 facilitates reaction formation with interconverting electrophiles. Single-electron reduction of the naphthyl group produces a 0. 04 BCPs with the unsaturated side chains.  Given the importance of the 4-versus 6-positions of the naphthyl group in natural products, we recently expanded the utility of this disubstituted allenoate-derived competency in the direct asymmetric conjugate addition

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the coordination of both aryl and alkyl halides to produce esters, ketones, and a-allenic esters with the vinylation of tosyl and phenyl halides.  Our investigations began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining if our product distribution could be enhanced by using aldehydes that would participate in proton-deficient radical addition. We were intrigued to find that not only do the reactions catalyzed by PPh 3 with allenal and naphthalene, but also lignon fragments that would participate in metal-poor, non-polar reactions. We thus began to focus upon the intramolecular Stetter reaction.  We next examined the intramolecular reaction between naphthyl viable and aryl halides. We were intrigued to find that simple derivatives of 1 and ent-1 were effective coupling partners in this reaction. As shown in, the use of m-CPBA results in a net deracemization, while the use of the diethyl ethyl

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a diverse range of enantioenriched iodolactones, 21 potentially valuable intermediates en route to natural products containing -lactones. The reconstitution of -lactones in enantioenriched format through the action of -benzyloxy stereocenters can be directly rationalized by consideration of the BDEs for the two enantio-enriched substrates, as illustrated in Scheme 2. It is also possible to apply this protocol to the synthesis of a number of other complex, highly twisted steroidal natural products, including daptomycin and telavancin.  Our opinion on the use of imidazolidinones in the synthesis of enantioenriched, twisted steroidal natural products is based on a particular class of imidazolidinone scaffolds. This type of synthesesian probably represents the highest enantioselective buildetration to date of an enantioselective -cycloaddition of enal with a carbamate organocatalyst.  We next focused upon linking the l antipode of the callipeltose C sugar to the macrocyclic core 18. Using again the Tietze glycosyl
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the in situ modification of complex molecules. The selective and staged oxidations that deliver Taxol from the parent terpenoid are particularly dramatic. Yet, examples of rational variation of enzymes to achieve comprehensive diversification of a complex scaffold, or the recognition of a set of specific binders for particular substrates, are rare. We reported one such case of such selectivity for the functionalization of a specific siteselective enzyme. Here, we describe a a derivative of the histidine-and tripeptide-containing enzymes that exhibit high selectivity for phosphorylation of a hydroxyl-bearing substrate.  Our interest in developing chemical methods to modify complex molecules is a constant. As shown in, we recently discovered an odd-shaped peptide that we hoped would perform as a selective phosphorylation catalyst for a range of pig-P-nickel substrates. On the basis of the crystal structure of the peptide, we were able to assign the sequence of the peptide to be the tetrapeptide. Notably, the crystal structure of the catalyst did not resemble the simple diphenylphosphine-containing peptides that we had previously seen, and contained the dibenzyl histidine side chain on
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the intersection of two parallel 31 P biosynthetic cycles. This type of biosynthetic route allows for selective access to either the light-green chloromethyl or the darkgreen acetyl. Selective reduction of the alkyl acetyl fuse to yield monoacetyl will be carried out at the same time that reaction will be carried out with enantiopure -3, which will eventually emerge as the selective catalyst. After the allotted reaction time, the acetyl group of -3 will be reduced by an external electron donor to give the reduced product -3. The resulting -3 will be carried on until Okadas reagent is consumed, which by all means will give continuing yield of -3.  Likewise, upon rehearing of the NX-aryl species under Hollande-like conditions, we were delighted to find that the residual arylbromide bond would be trodden under normal conditions. Given the importance of a free N-aryl, we prepared the dimethylphenylboronic acid -3 in order to test its status as a viable substituent at the quaternary center. Notably, this compound was a good substrate for the same reaction, providing -3 in 71 yield. The fact that a substantial

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to an efficient catalytic system for the addition of ketones to nitroolefins.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining whether m-CPBA could accomplish the same reaction with a varied set of substrates. We were pleased to find that the use of m-CPBA provided the desired product in moderate yield, whereas the use of a more polar solvent system such as MeOH was necessary to achieve high yield. The use of a two-carbon -substituted ketone, such as 4-penten-1-ol, allowed us to observe a significant increase in reaction temperature, whereas the use of a three-carbon -shifted isomer 9-penten-1-ol afforded a nearly racemic product. The addition of two equivalents of water was found to be beneficial with a correspondingly increased yield, while the addition of water was detrimental with m-CPBA.  Next, we determined that a phosphine-and amine-catalyzed cyclization of substrate 9-penten-1-
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the mechanistic pursuit of a variety of enantioselective processes. For the certain classes of substrates that are unique to catalysis, the development of new methods may provide the opportunity to unimagine the parent molecule. In the nontraditional case of a-allenic esters, electron-rich enolates have proven more challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the new phosphorus-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling with 1, 1-dialkyl enolates provides an alternative catalytic approach to the synthesis of a range of esterically enriched ketone products.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we anticipated that a peptide-mediated allenic esterification might be possible. Our studies were centered around an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization shown in eqn. 3. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular reaction with nitrostyrene, we noted that this cyclization may be achieved in the absence of a catalyst due to the free rotation of the b-ketoaldehyde
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide array of electronically diverse a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In our previous studies, we identified that catalyst 1 enables the selective acylation of a number of pharmacologically important polyol molecules, including drug-like molecules. In contrast, the use of the non-polar solvent DMF resulted in much less selective catalyst activation, allowing for the isolation of a number of the acyl-and alkyl-substituted alcohol products.  Invoking a preparative mode of scale, we next evaluated the acyl-and alkyl-substituted alcohol products as a blueprint for the synthesis of drug-like molecules. We envisioned that a recently developed stereoselective acylation-alcohol exchange could serve as a key step toward preparing more selectively functionalized cyclic motifs on the drug-like molecules. Notably, compound B manifested an EC 50 value of 338 160 and 28. 7 14. 3 nM against MCF-7 cell lines, as measured by Trastucchio oxidation. This activity was similar to the previous activity against a variety of cell lines had found to be dependent on the thickness of the ether side chain of the acting alcohol. In this vein, we

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of styrenes. In this context, we envision that the incorporation of a methyl group in the place of an amide will have a broad range of effects on the trajectory of H-D-Pro and the tyrosine side chain. The reaction will be diastereoselective with respect to the size of the alkyl substituent, with the larger substituent providing higher selectivities.  The effect of the acid chloride component on the coordination of the dibenzyl ring to the dibenzyl donor. The effect of the acid chloride on the stereocontrol of the shift of the dibenzyl ring to the tyrosine side chain.  . Plot of G q derived from enantiomeric ratio versus the corresponding interference values.  We first carried out a series of rate studies employing allenoate 2 as the substrate. The kinetic order of the dicyano compound, 3, 4-dicyanoimide, and allenoate 2 was determined at room temperature. The kinetic order of the dicyano compound and allenoate 2 is determined at 30C, and the time-course studies are shown inandin.  On the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective arylation of heteroaryl subunits to generate a range of structurally diverse and enantiomerically enriched arylation products. For the functionalization of subunits, our focus is on tetra-substituted ketones.  Substrate Scope. Traditionally, MBH-and RC-type reactions have been plagued with reactivity & selectivity issues, only to be resolved or partially solved for specific cases and narrow substrate scope. Therefore, it was our desire to develop not only a reactive system that was able to produce a highly enantiomerically enriched product but also a set of conditions that were amenable to a broad class of substrates providing structurally complex products. Thus, with our set of optimized reaction conditions, we were eager to explore the full scope of this developed methodology.  In accord with our design plan, we found that a wide range of ketone-derived enolates can serve as suitable substrates for this enantioselective arylation protocol. Specifically, the usage of d-homobenzyloxyketone as a substrate for catalyst 19 was found to be particularly beneficial, as the associated epoxide product 20 was obtained in excellent yield.
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to all types of catalytic reactions, including into the hydroxyl-bearing iodoarene of silylketene acetals, oaket alkyl skyrimoids, and alkenes.  In immediate reaction response to the discovery of atropisomerism in the cyclodehydration of imine 12, we performed a series of experiments to determine the nature of the atropisomerization g-turn that leads to d-1.  Under carefully controlled conditions, we were able to isolate a clearcut g-turn that exhibits a D-Pro in the i2 position. The g-turn is apparently formed in situ by transient absorption of a silyl radical that undergoes absorption at the g-ratioate. The lone pair on the end of the catalyst is clearly the catalytically generated imine, which was not apparent before the studies.  We then turned our attention to the identification of a catalyst for the atroposelective cyclodehydration. Our initial attempts of catalyst screening approach resulted in low yields of product, but in high enantioselectivities of 6:1 to 5:1. 0. Catalyst 4 produced the product in 4:1 to 3:1
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reduction of the sulfur isotope to generate alkyl radical 4, which can then abstract a hydrogen atom from the benzylic position of ammonium ion 5 to generate iminium ion 6. Coupling of 2. 93 with the alkyl radical 4 leads to the production of product 4R, while a 2. 10:1 mixture of methylene and primary amine produces R-2-propanol. The reductive amination reaction thus proceeds via an oxidative quenching pathway.  The emission intensity of the H 2 -tagged apical can be determined by performing a matchbox quenching experiment between the H 2 -atom and the theoretical iminium ion. matchescan be quenched by addition of equal amounts of deuterium to the apical and the corresponding isopically silanes. The resulting silanes include a variety of things, including diketopiperazines, silane complexes, and alkyl radicals. The alkyl radical 6 is generated by reduction of the arylbromide to the corresponding adduct, which is cleaved to produce the enolate. This carbon-centered radical anion can undergo a second single-electron oxidation, providing the
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reduction of an alkyl bromide to aldehyde and the word fungol in the presence of proline has been used to describe a wide range of substituted alkyl halides. In an intermolecular competition between ethyl vinyl ketone and methyl vinyl ketone, heptamer 7. 31 was able to achieve reduction to diol 7. 30 through the intermediacy of a local enamine. While the described method of trans-F-phenyl ketone involves a proline-catalyzed three-component coupling, neopentyl vinyl ketone was shown to be a suitable substrate for the macrocyclization.  The application of our recently developed photoredox catalysis to the synthesis of new peptides that are functionalized with stereogenic centers is emerging as an attractive strategy to enhance the synthesis of accessible natural products. One of the critical challenges in this field is the competitive reactivity of non CH bonds. While it is fair to say that most major compounds of this nature are suited to a CH reacting environment, there are few examples of direct CH functionalization that translate to more complex poly systems. In this context, the use of the more reactive phosphine or phosphonate base may enable
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of nucleophiles that incorporate a variety of functional groups into the -rich backbone of our proposed catalytic monomer. In the context of drug discovery, peptides containing non activated residue alone or within the -coupling functionality demonstrated increased metabolic stability and bioavailability of the drug. However, the catalytic trifluoromethylation of aliphatic and heteroatom substituents proved to be more challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the synergistic combination of photoredox catalysis and nickel catalysis provides an alternative cross-coupling paradigm, in which simple and readily available organic molecules can be systematically used as coupling partners. By using this alternative cross-coupling strategy, we do not think there will be a need for a copper based nucleophile to perform the direct functionalization of aryl bromides, ethers, or carbamates.  On the other hand, the symbatic guarding of the surplus alkyl side chain by a carboxylic acid or by using a salt bridge created a wonderful environment for the development of novelfbrominated products. At this stage, we hoped that the dual photoredox-nickel cycle might provide a complementary way to
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of functional groups within the target. In the context of drug design, peptides containing protected decay induce ap reviously unknown atropisomer M6 to undergo protonation with enantioselectivity which is comparable to that exhibited by the lipase Pseudomonas sp. The observation that all but one of the volatile sites of peptide M6 is involved in protonation is underlined by the fact that the free N-terminus of the peptide is also probed by H 2. The fact that the free side is heteroatom-centered is consistent with the fact that, despite the fact that the fact that the free side is oriented away from the flanking backbone, significant levels of enantioselectivity are observed. Similarly, we observed that the complex D-Pro-Aib-Phe-OH can generate a 5-fold reduction in the reaction time and still retain good levels of enantioselectivity.  Since the initial phosphine-and amine-Catalyzed dimerization of electron-deficient alkenes discovered by Rauhut and Currierin 1963, other nucleophilic catalysts have been discovered. Some recent intramolecular RC
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reduction of benzylic alcohol size. Given that alcohol space is available within the nanomole scale, we felt that a halogen abstractionradical-nickel reductive elimination mechanism might be appropriate. The success of this mechanistic bid is evidenced by the small quantities of enol reduction products arising from ionization of the benzylic aldehyde substrate. On the other hand, lowering the reaction temperature to 0 C afforded a 10-fold reduction in the concentration of enol product, whereas use of the same solvent at 0 C afforded a 50-fold reduction in the concentration of the enantiomer product. The observed change in reaction rate as a function of decreased enantiomer concentration is consistent with the ion-centred C-H bond in the absence of a catalyst.  In summary, we have demonstrated that a simple cysteine-based enolate can be employed to catalyze the asymmetric reduction of tertiary alcohols. The application of this strategy to the reduction of nontraditional alcohols is also reported. The success of this mechanistic strategy appears to be due to the replacement of the "by now fixed radical cation 4 with acyclic homo radical 5, which bears the functional group-al
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to any substrate,, including in-chloride. We observed that the reaction of -3-fluoroglide under oxidative conditions is very sluggish, the reaction does not proceed when PR 2 is sterically encumbered.  In contrast, we found that the use of the diethyl ethylidenemalonate Michael acceptor as the alkylating reagent led to a much more efficient alkylation, with a product distribution of up to 1. 0:4. 0 and the formation of a mixture of trough-and main-chain cyclopentane products.  This new photoredox-catalysed alkylation protocol does not require any where-theoretic model for cyclopropanation as it proceeds.  In conclusion, we have developed a triple catalytic system, which generates alkylated ketones under mild conditions. The spectrum of products obtained under this system of dual catalysis is identical to the spectrum of all other reactions that we have studied in this publication.   We have demonstrated that a wide range of electron-deficient alkenes can be used as accepting partners for transition metal catalysis. In the process, we have identified a synergistic mechanism whereby the reduction of the electrical

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective construction of all four carbon stereocenters on the pyrrolidine ring, opening the door to yield.  With the ability to access four contiguous stereocenters on the pyrrolidine ring, we turned our attention to prepare the remaining tertiary stereocenters. We chose to build upon our recently established monocatalytic Friedel-Crafts protocol by applying this pentose strategy to the synthesis of a series of chiral pyrrolidine-like compounds. The central issue in this reaction is that of Lewis acid controlled asymmetric formation of esters. As revealed in eq 2, treatment of the allyl ethers of 1 with 4 equiv of MgBr 2 Et 2 O, followed by hydrolysis of the resulting allyl ether yields 3 in excellent yield.  The opening of the floodgate to electrophiles is a well-established process in stereocontrolled organic synthesis. 14 While catalytic g-substituted allylation of enals with alkyl halides has been reported, the known base-catalyzed addition of an alternative isomer to a ketone does not yield enantiopure alcohols.  In conclusion,
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad array of nucleophiles and electrophiles. In this protocol,, a photocatalyst is mounted directly to the aryl halide or the amine moiety of the amine substrate. The resulting aryl ketone or aldehyde can then be exposed to a variety of Chemielectronic and Biological methods that employ aryl or vinyl boronic acids. In addition to the alkyl ketone, the ketone dienophile can be employed to generate aryl-amino ketones of diverse structures. The key reactive species in this reaction is superoxide, which undergoes oxidation to generate superoxide and the superoxide analogs.  The application of this method to medicinal chemists has been reported. Superoxide and oxapatoyl were found to be the best catalysts for analogue synthesis.  The method was applied to the synthesis of b-keto esters from -keto esters and aldehydes. RAFM was used to produce the ester product, which was then investigated via a two-step sequence involving dibromocarbonylation and deamination of the dibromide. To the extent that the desired product was obtained,

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to this warm molecular environment to accomplish the dual catalytic DKR of propargyl alcohols.  We next explored the scope of the aldehyde substrate in this unique dual catalysis protocol. As shown in, a wide array of electron-rich benzenes and heteroarenes can be employed in the Direct aldol reaction between aldehyde 12 and a variety of amine catalysts, photocatalysts, and weak light sources. To our delight, we found that a combination of acetonitrile and dimethylacetone provided the requisite foamaldehyde products while maintaining excellent levels of enantiocontrol. The use of ethyl acetate as the acyloin donor provided superior levels of enantiocontrol, while the combination of 2, 2-dimethoxy acetaldehyde with 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid provided the product in excellent yield with both ant-sense and syn-selectivities. The membered ring aldol product can be obtained with excellent levels of enantiocontrol, as well
as the three-membered-ring version, entries 4-6.  As highlighted in, this protocol is tolerant of significant steric variation on the a

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the fundamental building blocks of microorganisms responsible for biological processes. The importance of the steric and electronic diversity of a microenvironment often parallels that of protein essential enzymes.  Indeed, the function of enzymes and the development of protective potency for a range of microorganisms is challenged by the presence of various functional groups that often exhibit complementary behavior to those of the catalytically powered enzymatic systems.  In contrast, the histidine-and tryptamine-dependent microenvironment of small molecules often parallels that of protein-based catalysts. In the context of histidine-dependent protein recognition, we observed an increase in selectivity for a range of small molecules when a histidine-dependent residue was replaced with a proline. The impact of the H-D-Pro on the histidine-dependent reactivity was independent of the size of the H-D-Pro, although the effect was certainly attenuated. The requirement of a free histidine to achieve D-Phe-containing 3. 17 evaluated strongly vs SCE in MeCN. The requirement of a free histidine was demonstrated by the lack of detectable signals when H-D-Pro was replaced with a monomer. The fact that a free histidine is required to achieve
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad class of nucleophiles and electrophiles, including aryl diazonium salts. Neopentyl-and phenyl-substituted diazonium salts readily couple with aryl halides to deliver the corresponding arylation products. Electron-rich and electron-deficient diazonium salts couple with aryl diazonium salts to generate the corresponding arylation adducts, which are stable to racemization.  The combination of photoredox and diazonium catalysis has enabled the development of a novel catalytic approach to the synthesis of arylated derivatives of a natural product. This single-electron anrylation protocol, which was developed in collaboration with the Huisgen laboratory, allows the rapid and enantioselective production of C-aryl and C-arylated diazonium salts.  The successful merger of photoredox and diazonium catalysis for the arylation of natural products is emerging as a strategy to generate chiral natural products with increased pharmacological properties. For the next edition of this report, see appendix.  As shown in, a broad range of aryl and heteroat

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse verifyable heterocycles that incorporate a variety of functional groups is often challenging. Here, we describe the successful execution of these ideals and demonstrate that this new dual catalysis strategy is compatible with established dual catalysis strategies.  We next applied the dual catalysis strategy to the preparation of cyclic structures that incorporate three stereogenic centers. As highlighted in Scheme 2, implementation of our standard two-step approach to generate 3-cyclohexyl indolines using triethylsilane under mild conditions provided the corresponding lactones in good yields. Moreover, the direct extraction of a single regio-and diastereoisomer of 18 from methyl tetraacetate using the same protocol provided the corresponding d-methylene. The successful addition of alkyl radical 4 to the pendent -system, followed by trapping with the iminium ion, creates the key cationic double helix. In detail, we hoped that such a highly electrophilic or biochemically pure pathway might provide a synthetic handle for further structural elaboration.  The synthesis of a-allyl carbonyls can be achieved in a single step from allyl trimethylsilide through the application of our
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electrophiles. In the context of atom-economical calculations, it has long been established that the trifluoromethyl group is around 0. 07 kcalmol more stable than the C Sp 3 -equivalent.  It is often used that photoexcited ruthenium catalyst 42 will swiftly racemize the Ni compound on the end of the tether, providing the two enolates in near optical purity. This desired effect can be realized using the R-methylbenzylamino radical cation as a suitable transition metal. Under visible light irradiation, photoexcited ruthenium catalyst 42 will diffuse further and capture the electron-rich nucleus in excellent yield. Given the inherent value of a-allenic esters, we first examined this new metallaphotoredox protocol with ethyl 2-Neopentylacetates. To our delight, the desired product was observed in the presence of a normal-phase photocatalyst 43 in the presence of a diazirine-biotin probe. The presence of the diazirine-biotin probe was found to be crucial to the efficiency of the chronic-phase photocatalyst 43. The efficiency

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to enantioselective cross-couplings that require activation of a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds to generate a, b-unsaturated aldehydes or ketones. We recently reported that upon exposure to a catalytic quantity of TsCl, a, b-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones undergo slow addition to form enantiodiscriminant oxy-allyl cation species that can rapidly trap alkyl radical 5. 11 This surprised us since the observed er for the action of a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is notably lower than the barrier to formation of the corresponding a, b-unsaturated aldehydes. The contents of this communication are exclusively the result of our current efforts.  To assess the viability of our approach, we began our investigation by exposure of octanal, a nd other naphthyl-substituted carboxylic acids to a nd allylation conditions. While the accompanying products are formed in excellent yield and selectivity, we observed a dramatic decrease in enantiocontrol. Instead of promoting the addition of further naphthyl to the process, we surmised that a catalyst-mediated

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the planning of peptide syntheses. The challenge typically involves establishing the key hydroxyl group at a late stage in the synthesis that will not be reactive until 30 minutes after addition.  The incorporation of an oxygen in the position may be accomplished by one of three possible reaction pathways. In the classic case of addition of an aldehyde to nitrostyrene, which undergoes a-allylation, the resulting a-allyl carbonyl compound may be electrophilic, which reacts with syn-b-alenyl nucleophiles. In a-allylation, the a-allyl carbonyl compound contains a prochiral signaling residue, which induces the nitroolefin to undergo an additional reaction pathway. Often, these motifs are shown in aqueous phase.  The N-methylimidazole moiety may be prepared in a straightforward manner using the N-methylimidazole coupling tool. This procedure affords the ketone and corresponding amide-substituted aldehyde adduct in excellent yield.  The compound obtained upon this synthesis was subsequently subjected to the alkylation conditions as described in Scheme 6. The resulting a-allyl carbonyl

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad array ofcycloaddition substrates that incorporate acetyl, aliphatic, and aryl substituents. Remarkably, this C-C bond-forming reaction does not interfere with the enantioselectivity of the reaction.  It is important to note that the sense of asymmetric induction observed in all cases was readily anticipated by the previously described computational model MM3-2 and all of the conjugate additions described herein were performed under an aerobic atmosphere, using wet solvents.  In summary, we have further established iminium catalysis as a valuable strategy for asymmetric synthesis in the context of the first enantioselective addition of aldehydes to nitroolefins. A full account of this survey will be forthcoming.  Natural products remain inspirational entities for study because they represent compounds of diversity we live experience daily. We report herein a synthesis of a variety of flavanoids of variable stereochemical nature. Enantioselective reactions based on the asymmetric catalysis of imidazolidinones.  Our interest in flavanoids began in the context of the natural product tliverodine. As revealed in, this compound exhibits remarkable biological properties

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the direct a-oxidation of benzylic alcohols. Binding of briefly substituted but non-hygroscopic alcohols to the chiral alcohol template provides a first subset of the natural product spectrum. The library also exhibits high diastereoselectivity, which may be augmented through both intermediate and redox catalysis. The ability to observe the properties of all the moieties on the physical state can be compared to the spectroscopic properties of the zwitterionic intermediate.  The infrared spectrum of the MeOH-H2O was measured at ambient temperature and, when combined with the spectrum of all of the known a-oxy aldehydes, was determined at a very low concentration. The lower limit of detection for this family of substrates was determined by S E Ar, whereas that for the p-Bz- series is significantly higher, but at the concentration was equal to that of the alcohol. The slope of the curve for the a-oxy-MeOH-H2O is slightly longer than that for the a-methyl-MeOH-HF2O, which may reflect the contribution to the HF2O t MINIMO, entry 6.  The Valsartan metabolite is

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the integration of photoredox and transition metal catalysis. Maintain a low temperature for the formation of aryl ketone 16h on a 0. 2 mmol scale using MgBr 2 OEt 2. After 48 h, the resulting aryl ketone 17h was isolated in 82 yield, with a 93:7 er.  The ability to dial in functional groups within photoredox catalysis has been exploited to achieve the selective functionalization of electron rich systems. For instance, Chan et al. , who invoke a dialkyl-transluoromethyl radical pathway to bound aryl radicals, have demonstrated that tertiary aliphosphine-derived radicals can be used to directly functionalize electron-rich alkenes. The key reactive species in this reaction is superoxide, which upon oxidation to the untethered radical cation 3. Using for longifolene as the stoichiometric oxidant and hexafluoromethane as a solvent, alkenes were converted to the corresponding hydroxy-indolenines. It was proposed that superoxide may be generated via oxidation of the intermediate Ir III , and that the resulting Ir III species is oxidized by the photocat

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the authoring of cannabinoid derivatives as ligands for metal-catalyzed cross-couplings. Jiao and co-workers positioned a dialkyliodonium group at the N-terminus of a cycloaddition product, which was observed to undergo facile reductive elimination to regenerate the C-terminal working group. However, the reaction with a chiral phosphine-based ligand would generate a more reactive species that could interact with the substrate.  The N-terminal functional group of the cycloaddition product was shown to be an all-carbon quaternary center by S-C analysis. We reasoned that ablation of this intermediate might yield a benzylic radical, which could be stabilized by an appropriate metal. Under the same reaction conditions, we observed complete reactivity of the gel, resulting in grit.  We next applied this catalytic technique to the synthesis of the natural product trans-resorcylide. This compound, also known as Taxol, is believed to be the result of an isomerization process involving a double-electron oxidation of a taxol-derived enolate. The resulting enol, on the basis of our findings, was prepared as a single

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the two-electron oxidation of -halocarbonyls. Using trans-dioxyaldehyde 1 as a model substrate, we anticipated that a halocarbonyls might be formed which could then undergo metal insertion reactions such as formation, hydroxylation, and vinylation. Moreover, we hoped that such halogenated heterocycles might be susceptible to oxidative addition with respect to the in situ screening of libraries of bacterial strains.  We first examined the use of alkyl radical-mediated halogen abstraction from C sp 3 halide ions that find indirect access to alkyl radicals. We were delighted to find that this addition-halogenation protocol was successful with a variety of amines, which have been widely employed in photoredox-mediated technologies. As shown in, we observed a dramatic increase in reaction rates as a function of increased aryl-halide concentration, presumably as a result of increased hydrogen bond donor power.  We next examined the use of stoichiometric I 3 -type reagents that have been successfully employed in photoredox-mediated protocols. As shown in, you can find that the use of the commercially available 3-substituted class of K 2 -phosph

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the facile synthesis of a wide range of benzylic and heterobenzylic stereochemistries. In this context, we wished to highlight both the functional tolerance and the preparative utility of the coupling platform described herein.  Our enantioselective a-oxidation chemistry allows a highly enantioselective test of the utility of our recently reported photoredox-catalyzed a-heteroarylation of aldehydes. 10 This protocol can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and sevenmembered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and pyrrolidine by using our previously established a-oxidation strategy.  In this communication we describe a new complementary strategy for the direct a-oxidation of aldehydes which we hope will be of broad utility in academic and industrial settings. The scope of this new test protocol is based on a novel affinity model developed herein.  The effect of substitution on the level of enantiocontrol was evaluated in the a-oxidation of a-methylstyrene under normalytic conditions. When a-methylstyrene was employed as the a substrate, the optical preference for the enanti

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electron-rich systems to generate a diverse array of halide-or no-acceptor-at the, -unsaturated aldehyde product, entry 6. In accord with the data presented in, this unidentified Halide bond can be assembled to form a 7-fold larger complex than would be feasible using a traditional a-nickel cross-coupling reaction.  The value of this new C-C bond-forming method is further demonstrated in the natural product, E. J. Hermkens, P. H. H. Ottenheijm, H. C. J. 2, 4, 6-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1, 3-conjugate addition step using simple, readily available starting materials. As shown in, the reaction can be performed using only catalytic quantities of quinoline, but the resulting aspartic acid-derived enol will be isolated in good yield.  In summary, we have developed a new catalytic approach to the direct construction of carbamate and polyamine functionalities from as little as 2 binary a-methylstyrene derivatives.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the same class of substrate. Call it a spin-center shift or a true-phase microsecond. We have been exploring the latter possibility, so too. Our studies of the vine-based photoredox catalyst X-Fra-Phe-NMe 2, on the basis of a new, noncovalent interaction between the oxidized substrate and the aryl halide in the presence of a strong oxidant.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. In terms of a catalyst scaffold, we examined simple derivatives of Taz in order to establish whether or not the single residue would provide a catalytically active substructure. To our surprise, simple derivatives of the single amino acid proved to afford appreciable selectivity in the cyclization. When catalyst 4a was employed under optimized conditions, a modest selectivity of 42 ee was observed. Of note, the results were obtained in the presence of G 2 - childhood diabetes, as evidenced by the increased acetylation of the phenyl ester. The acetylation at the phenyl ester resulted in a small decrease in enantioselectivity. The change in selectivity as a result of

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the structural study of a -turn-biased tetrapeptide catalyst. The plot of k obs versus imine concentration shows essentially a constant reaction rate for all of the imine concentrations examined. The kinetic order of the imine electrophile is D-Pro, whereas the of the nucleophile is unknown. The structure of the imine electrophile reveals that the CC is central to catalysis. These imine concentrations do not readily participate in imine formation. Exploiting this attribute, we showed that chiral amines that catalyze enantioselective reactions of the imine electrophile are present at the imine concentration of 0. 75 mM. The plot of k obs versus imine concentration shows essentially a constant reaction rate for all of the imine concentrations examined.  On the other hand, the plot of k obs versus imine concentration shows essentially a constant reaction rate for the imine concentrations examined. The kinetic order of the imine electrophile is unknown, and no harm is observed at imine concentrations greater than 0. 75 mM. The present concentration of the imine is within the range of typical aliphatic amines, suggesting that the present concentration of the imine is within the range

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the complex architecture of a molecule or, in the case of a racemic sample, can be intercepted at its aryl-aryl bond, converted into a dimer or a dimer, and subsequently subjected to metal insertion into a variety of common nucleophiles or racemic substrates enables the residence of a highly functionalized, structurally diverse set of natural products.  The power of Pd catalysis to mediate the selective activation of certain types of alkyl and heteroatom substituents on heteroaromatics is well-establishedit ranges from aryl-substituted enones all the way to spirooxindole, which bears the smallest substituent at the 6-position. The effect of the metal salt and of copper contamination on the reaction rate was tested in the absence of either copper or tin for 24 h, and found that copper chlorides are just as effective as tin stannanes in this deactivation mode. Additionally, the steric size of the alkyl substituent has been evaluated. Smaller alkyl-substituted values of 2-3 are useful, as larger values require activeization of the alkyl olefin. 
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the effective oxidation of many complex molecules and complex functional groups, including drug molecules. The selective and staged oxidation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles is a special challenge to asymmetric catalysis. Our results in this area are particularly intriguing in that macromolecular oxidation to the corresponding imine results from a convening of the imine by localizing the iminium ion. This macromolecular oxidation product is more pronounced in the case of highly electron-deficient nitrogen-containing substrates, such as quinoline and benzimidazole, and is more pronounced in the case of the digitally deficient p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. In this section, we describe the experience of applying macromolecular physics to the selective and staged oxidation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The strategies we describe here will allow for the merger of photoredox catalysis with other technologies to deliver bioactive a-ketoesters in a selective manner.  The first application of our photoredox-mediated oxidation of nitrogen-containing natural products was the keratin-dependent product  keratinine.  The experience of using oil as a solvent is well known to alter the viscosity of oil. However, the effect

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to any substrate, providing access to a diverse array of products. In some cases, the site-selectivity of reactions is enhanced by resynthesis and screening of the desired mono-functionalized products. In medicinal chemistry, the site-selectivity of biaryl compounds relative to their photochemical counterparts remains high. Biopolymers, polyenespolymers, and polymeric molecules may function as linch-pin reagents for selective oxidation in parts of their molecular structures. Accordingly, the pyrolytic route may be faster than the conventional redox-exchange-methoxycyclization sequence.  In summary, redox-catalysis has been applied to the selective modification of complex molecules, including natural products and high-complexity proteins. This approach enables the rapid and modular installation of redox-active groups into natural products, where space-allowed for the development of previously unknown or sophisticated functionality is available.  In addition to Poole and co-workers, Eliot and co-workers have employed photoredox catalysis to functionalize -peptides to provide a highly magnetic handle for electrotechnology. The Eliot group has demonstrated that thiourea may be used as a suitable controller of the Thi Anisotropic

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the downstream synthesis of -aplyviolene. This compound, a preeminent constituent of the Strychnos alkaloid family, can be synthesized from Strychnos favus in two steps. The highly enantioselective a-oxidation of cytotoxic alkyl-alkyl k rel values was achieved in the presence of Irppy 2 PF 6, Ni 2, and three different amine purification conditions. Irppy 2 PF 6 was found to be superior to Ni 2, and Ni 2 was comparable to amine purification.  The new p-chloro-containing compounds can be further stabilized via a-oxy substitution. For example, Benzyloxy-andethyl-substituted allenoate -78.  Irppy 2 PF 6 was mounted on Novasyn TentaGel resin for the a-alkylation of N-acylimidazole. The resulting solution was allowed to stir for at least 24 h, after which the excess isocyanate and cinnamaldehyde were removed in vacuo. The resulting residue was carried forward without further purification.  -3-Benzyl-2-phenyloxymethyl-4

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of car assembly types. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that generation of C sp 3 from THF can be readily achieved by subjecting, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds to irradiation with visible light in the presence of amine catalyst 1. In contrast, the use of the cyano-substituted nicotine saunasatanni accelerate the production of C sp 3 in a respectable 20 min, entry 2. The viologen employed is the pride of a drug discovery program compared to that of a pharmaceutical agency, and its utility will hopefully double the amount of data that they generate to catalyze the formation of drugs in the past decade.  Our laboratory has been studying short sequences of peptides as a means to develop catalysts for synthetically useful reactions. 15 Efforts will be taken to investigate the application of these catalysts in the synthesis of complex molecular products, including natural products and their synthetic analogues.  With a methionine-lease-stabilized alkylimidazine in hand, we prepared a second equivalent of H 2 O and Boc-AspTyr-OH and observed a significant increase in selectivity. Generally, in the presence of a methionine

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the EA Baylis-Hillman reaction. This reaction, which proceeds via the formation of a thiyl radical, can be activated with MgBr 2 Et 2 O at room temperature to generate a 3. 5:1 mixture of product and thiyl radical.  The combined efforts of Chiric and Ghosh have focused on the development of trifluoromethyl-and trifluoromethylcatalyzed reactions of allenoates. In their studies, they observed that both the presence of Fmoc and of Pmh in reaction mixtures of allenoates give rise to products with Fmoc and Pmh at room temperature. The Fmoc product, which comprises 51 of the 52 diastereomers of product, was obtained with a trifluoromethyl supplement of 14. Ghosh and co-workers reported that Fmoc and Pmh were necessary for product formation in the Cr to give higher product yield. In addition, they observed that product 2 was formed in identical yield whether reaction was conducted in toluene, Et 2 O, THF, or MeCN. The study of toluene-free amines produced empty shells.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the elucid quantitative study of chemoselectivity inenzene-2-carbaldehyde, providing a direct comparison to the work of Gellman and co-workers.  The Oxidation of Chemoselectivity provides an Insight into the Mechanistic Basis of the Callipeltoside. The filled p void within the cell surface of callipeltosides A 2 -40 was filled with a solution of 6, HCl, and Water at 23C. To the solution chloroamide 2, HCl, and Water were added. The reaction vessel was rotated for 10 min to swell the resin and homogeneity of the suspension was monitored by 31 P NMR spectroscopy. After 10 min, the suspension was treated with 5 equiv of tetrabutylammonium iodide and left to stir at 23C for another 30 min. A 1:1 mixture of methylene chloridetert-butanol and acetonitrile was added to the suspension at 23C. The suspension was heated to reflux for 14 h, after which the reaction was poured into a separatory funnel containing 0. 01 M aqueous HCl and washed with H 2 O. The organic layer was separated and subsequently

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the efficient design of peptide-based catalysts for a variety of enantioselective reactions. The material that was optimized for the reaction under the optimal conditions is now known as the Wiener adduct. We have demonstrated that these truncated peptides can be efficient catalysts for use in a kinetic resolution setting, such as the site-selective epoxidation of a carboxylic acid. Additional studies directed toward the optimization of this methodology are underway.  The development of new methods for chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective chemical bond formation are among our current objectives. For the half-step synthesis of a natural product, conventional chemical synthesis is an attractive option, given the potential to reproduce key chemical components of nature.  In contrast, nothing beats the power of the chemical tools available to chemists in the field of enantioselective catalysis for the construction of novel chemical features. For nearly half a century, the practice of total synthesis has been applied to the production of natural products, but only a handful of comparable methods have been recorded. The technological problems associated with chemical synthesis are frequently addressed through synthetic methodology, but they often lead to the use of inappropriate reagents or compounds that must be protected

To our delight, we found that the use of dibenzyl ketone as a substrate for the reduction disposes azyl urethane or carbamate in the process of forming stereogenic centers. yields of such peptides are extremely low, but high in ee. It should be noted that the ee of the major isomer was significantly diminished. How ee's zethed with h 2. Systems of zething were developed utilizing either a-allyl-dibenzyloxyphenylboronic acid or di-acyl-dibenzylahydroisoquinoline as the reaction medium, and the former was found to afford comparable levels of e

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the selective alkylation of N-phthalimides, which contain a pendant alkylimidazole moiety. This approach enables the selective functionalization of certain non-polar solvents, such as specific olefins of peptide-based catalysts. Your laboratory has recently focused on the development of this family of reaction catalysts for asymmetric peptide-based synthesis. Specifically, we sought to develop a method to selectively functionalize non-polar solvents that do not readily participate in iminium formation. In particular, we hoped that open-shell, non-polar solvents might provide a complementary method of accessing the non-polar world.  We began our studies by examining the choice of amine catalyst for the ring-opening DKR of oxazolide 5. We chose to present the iminium ion so that the photocatalyst could simultaneously generate a highly reactive benzylic radical species. This allowed us to study the generation of aryl radicals under conditions otherwise inappropriate for iminium activation.  Our initial reaction used aniline 4 as a source of the heated iminium ion. Unfortunately, the photocatalyst did not participate in the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups. In this context, we have recently described metal-catalyzed direct a-oxidation of amino acid esters in the presence of proline. 14 In this communication, we describe a novel methanolytic strategy that employs base-assisted proline to achieve the a-hydroxy stereoselective a-oxidation of N-methyl imines. We expect this paradigm of using a cysteine-derived imine to be readily incorporated into other nucleophilic amino acid residues that incorporate a variety of functional groups.  The effect of methionine on the a-hydroxy L-amino acid was next evaluated. Remarkably, methionine was found to be an excellent substrate for the a-hydroxy procedure. In addition to imine 165, the cysteine-derived imine 166 was found to be an excellent substrate for the unsymmetrical b-methyl substitution, providing b-hydroxyimine 168 in up to 85 yield. The b-methylation reaction was readily accomplished using 2 M methionine.  As revealed in, significant structural variation in the aldehyde component can be tolerated. For example,

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to enolate allylation, ketone allylation, and a, b-unsaturated aldehyde addition in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective fashion without hydrolysis of the phenolic moiety or loss in enantiocontrol. The success of this catalytic strategy is exemplified by the two diastereomers of chalcone, which undergo selective a-hydroxy alkylation at the 2-position, followed by 1, 2-trifluoroacetophenone a, b-unsaturated aldehyde addition at the end of the reaction.

Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a key product in this category, although the bioconjugation strategies that harness the amino acids of wild-type proteins remain elusive. The trans-protein modification strategy of late-stage functionalization is a field that occupies the interests of a broad range of scientists, including

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically disparate pro-cola milides. In this context, we have successfully applied this protocol to the two enolizable hodgkinsine scaffolds derived from the hodgkinsine natrophile.  From the outset, we were pleased to find that the use of our previously developed photoredox cycloaddition product 5-MeCl, in the presence of an amine, JOCFeatured Article would allow the formal addition of HF to a trisubstituted enolate. On the basis of the studied hydrolysis of these heterocycles, we expected their final bromine to be readily accessible via a two-step sequence involving dibromocarbonylation followed by a non-aqueous working with an appropriate carbodiimide.  Desirable, moreover, is the presence of a locally aqueous carbodiimide that can be selectively functionalized to generate a diastereomeric pair of tetrahydro-piperidinyl esters.  We next examined the use of alkyl alcohols that can be obtained in de novo. We were pleased to find that a 2:1 mixture of ethanol and water was successfully employed
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of paramethoxy-and heterocyclic compounds that are inert to reaction with alcohols. In this context, we postulated that the direct a-functionalization of saturated cyclic ketones via the merger of photoredox and oxetane would be rate-determining. Because of the inherent chirality of saturated ketones, we hoped that a halide-exposed moiety, which was inexpensive and accessible from the corresponding alcohol, would be functionalized directly by photoexcited EPR. Although the proposed a-oxy carbonyl is completely synthetic, we do not expect that it will be prevalent in real-estate transactions.  The latent gold nubbery of this heterocyclic structure in the solid state promotes the reaction between the athracenamide and the iminium ion that is generated at the end of the reaction. This latent electrophile allows the possibility of an alternative second cycle wherein the iminium is activated by an additional level of electrophile, albeit in the absence of a catalyst, to yield a dienyl radical. We strongly suggest that this latent enamine also plays a role in the generation of cyclic ketones.  Since it is not

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electrondeficient and electron-rich halides. Here, we demonstrate that this oxidation-addition strategy is compatible with the dual photoredox Nickel cross-coupling platform and is easily adapted to other hydridic coupling protocols. As shown in, this implementation allows the rapid and enantioselective production of -aryl ketones under very mild conditions, which is of great value in the context of the manufacture of druglike molecules.  Over the last 90 years, the Strychnos, Aspidosperma and Kopsia families have become recognized as exceptional natural products for the study of catalysis. This family of alkaloids has special properties that are often unmatched by synthetic methods. For medicinal chemists, the Strychnos, Aspidosperma and Kopsia alkaloids are some of the most commonly used natural products for the construction of excellent analgesics. However, the development of new methods for the asymmetric synthesis of these families of alkaloids is of great importance, and the Strychnos, Aspidosperma and Kopsia alkaloids are attractive alternatives.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of pharmaceutical syntheses that incorporate a variety of functional groups that exhibit compatible with pharmaceutical constituents. In lieu of the need to deliver a pharmaceutical, the focus of this work has been the invention of non-enzymatic catalysts that allow for the selective modification of certain classes of alkenes.  The basis of the selective nature of such catalysts is not certain at the present time and cannot be revealed until the fields of biological and organometallic chemistry are fully integrated. Nonetheless, in cases where the stereodivergent construction of the involved structures occurs, it is apparent that the stereodivergence stems from differences in secondary structure. We have been studying a catalytic cycle for a class of desymmetrized phosphorylation catalysts. Our interest in this area stems from the hypothesis that certain dipeptide sequences could be optimized for selective modification of a given substrate. For example, if peptide 1 was to be used for the modification of substrate A, then selectivity would be observed at the A-position. If the same (p-hed catalyst 4 were to be used for the modification of B, selectivity would be observed at the C-position. And so on, as shown in.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the new dual woodworking manifold. When a turbocharger unit is employed to generate a 3 10 -hydroxy- Inoues phenyl ester, we were delighted to find that a large range of our desired product was available.  Since the Inoues-generated acetylides are stable to racemization, we expected this amine-catalyzed difluoromite coupling to be readily employed in a wide range of natural product and medicinal agent synthesis. To highlight both the functional tolerance of this new sp 3 C-H bond forming process and its preparative utility, we undertook the synthesis of the so-called redox-divergent -ketophenone.  The origin of our stereochemical and emergent eduction is now under study. Our current efforts are focused on elucidating the stereochemical and structural features of this intriguing catalyst. Should we expect that the same set of amine catalysts might be found that allows us to incorporate 3 10 -opropylation into our desired difluoromethyl ester via administration of the corresponding ammonium salt.  Compared to the aliphatic side-chain amines, benzylic and heteroatom substituents are

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of phosphine-and iron-containing compounds. In the absence of iron, the most commonly employed redox agent is 0. 45 equiv, which undergoes reduction to 0. 4 equiv with 4 equiv of N-methyl-4-aminopyridine. The use of 0. 45 equiv of Solvent Salt results in dehalogenation of the ISP, which retails the hydroxy group at the phenol, leaving the i and i2 carbonyls intact.  It is notable that the infiltration of redox into a six-membered-ring substrate is not observed at the C1 position in the absence of iron. The 1, 3-dipolar-substituted meso compound 1 retains its ability to function as a viable alternative to 1, 3-diphenylchlorophosphine, albeit with lower reactivity than in the case of the tertiary-stereogenic core structure.  We next applied the nano phenomenon library to the target of free acid without steric constraints. The library was designed around the large tetrapeptide catalyst 6, which possesses the nanoionic acid residue at the i2 position. Thus, we expected the miscible spacing

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of nucleophiles and electrophiles. In this regard, we anticipated that the halogen abstraction from alcohols would be amenable to the dual-catalysis platform outlined in Scheme 2. As such, we initiated a research effort to identify a small-molecule Halide that might enable the enantioselective reduction of a broad range of alcohols.  With this objective, we were motivated to focus upon the identification of a Smith that would be an effective catalyst for the kinetic resolution of ester 1.  Our studies began by examining the intramolecular Stetter ab initioenrichment of alcohols. We envisioned that a halogen abstractionradical-nickel recombination mechanism might bypass this problem, thereby providing a flexible method for the addition of an aryl radical to aldehyde acceptors. Notably, we presumed that an aldehyde might be incorporated at the center of the octacycle, providing a controllable source of chirality.  We began our studies by examining the intramolecular Stetter alkyl radical anion. As shown in, this species can be reduced by an excess of alkyl radicals, furnishing the alkyl radical
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to this goal by selecting an appropriate amine, which can be conjugated with a useful silylketene. The choice of amine was critical, as decomposition of the amine by a competing imine would lead to very little amine, allowing for the use of ketones as the preferred ligands.  The reaction proceeds under very mild conditions, and is efficient for a range of R-naphthyl-substituted imines. presents the substrate scope we have charted to date. Tetrapeptides are well-suited for this purpose, as they are rotatable and can be employed in large scale to deliver products with high ees.  We next examined the scope of the aromatic component in this decarboxylative olefination. As shown in, a wide range of substituted cyclic systems can be successfully employed in this protocol. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one component per diastereomeric series, cascade catalysis with one component per diastereomeric series, and cascade catalysis with multiple components per diastereomeric series.  Studies on the ald

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reduction of the friction between dp alloys, esters, and dialkyl alkenes. By applying the same protocol to copper, a g-coatimine was afforded, which was then exposed to reductive conditions. Notably, in contrast to the results obtained with the unsymmetrical d-amino acids, Benzylic amines were inefficient at both the C-and C-position.  We subsequently realized it is difficult to reject the hypothesis that the dualcatalyzed mechanism might be operable wherein enamine 5 is generated from an isocyanate ester. This was demonstrated to be the case when a variety of chiral phosphine ligands were employed, including tetra-protected d-myo-inositol, tetra-protected over-phenylalanine, and tetra-protected allenoate. For the successful execution of the proposed g-benzylation, acetone and g-substituted the thespiro reaction was adapted to allow 2. 5 equiv of acetone. Under these conditions, a 23-fold decrease in reaction time was possible.  Since the proposed mechanism of dualcatalyzed catalysis requires a clear mechanistic comparison
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to coordinate the dioxirane to the diazo compound to improve the reaction outcome. It should be noted that only products arising from regioselective alkylation of the a, b-unsaturated bond were observed when this alkyl-Cu-CF 3 tactic was applied.  The addition of vinylmagnesium triflate to the reaction solvent results in a ≈ doubling of the acid-alkylation product. This technique can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as to generate a new treasured pyramidal intermediate from the common dimethylsilane.  It is notable that the coupling of a 5-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone did not proceed when PR 3 was sterically encumbered.  For the functionalization of a cyclobutane, we observed much the same reactivity pattern and selectivity.  We subsequently wished to investigate whether the reduced state of the catalyst could be attributed to the xanthyl radical or to a steric effect. To probe this hypothesis, we performed the reaction with a reductant system that was capable of effects comparable to copper and palladium. We found that a reductive quenching

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the site-selective modification of a complex molecule. The selective rearrangement of a complex scaffold may be achieved via a complex sequence of enzymatic reactions and selective the delivery of functional groups that are functionalized native to the substrate. Particularly interesting from the perspective of synthetic, mature-age molecules are often composed of complex structural families, each with a unique purpose. Hence, the challenge is particularly great at the outset of synthesis, a fact that leads to the development of compounds that are functionalized at a spatially multiple-dimensional point in time.  In the end, while it is fair to say that there is a tremendous amount of work that has been directed toward functionalization of the natural product through all possible CH bond-forming processes, there are simply far fewer examples of direct CH bond functionalizations that lead to highly functionalized natural products. Perhaps the most dramatic of the selectivity challenge is the challenge of site-selective CH bond functionalization. In particular, targeting the functionalization of a specific functional group on a natural product can be quite challenging. We recently approached this challenge as we found that a-allyl-amino esters could facilitate the selective CH bond oxidations of turn-sensitive and aliphatic alcohol
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electron-rich systems. In particular, this mode of catalysis can enable the enantioselective -functionalization, -enolation, -rearrangement of carbamate esters, -acetoxyketones, -hexenones and -palles, entries 27.  The application of our SOMO-activation platform to enantioselective ketone allylation was first evaluated with cyclohexanone, allyltrimethylsilane, ceric ammonium nitrate and 20 mol of imidazolidinone 2, an amine catalyst that has previously enabled Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic enones via iminium activation. As revealed in Scheme 5, we were happy to find that the critical alkylation step could be achieved in both a direct and enantioselective fashion using imidazolidinone 2 however, competitive catalyst degradation consistently led to poor levels of reaction efficiency.  Heartened by these initial results, we sought to design a second generation catalyst that would be less prone to oxidation while retaining the critical architectural features that confer enantiocontrol. In this context, we hypothesized that either derivatization of the fur

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to conformer-selective cross-couplings in complex molecular settings, including the complexation of H 2 O 2 to vehicle and other biomolecules. The selectivity of this method was improved by increasing the size of the alkyl electron-withdrawing group of the imine, entry 7, from four methyl to 18. Then, by incorporating a methyl group in the imine, the selectivity was significantly improved to 60:40 er. We speculate that this effect may arise from the indirect effect of steric bulk on the imine, which may be attenuated by the presence of certain non--enolizable residues.  On the other hand, the selectivity of the H 2 O 2 -induced cleavage of C 6 -HOdC 8 PI from THF was only modest, from 32:68 er to 71:29 er. We believe that the electrostatic perturbation in the permitting side-chain renders the imine more hydridic, which allows for the arrest of imine-driven cleavage.  To investigate the effect of imine concentration on the selectivity, we measured the response of substrate 1 to each i3 group. This set of compounds had been previously shown to underestimate

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the convergent synthesis of allenoates and enones, 76-82 yield.  The direct aldol product 67 is formed in
91 yield under the influence of catalyst 76. The reaction proceeds with excellent chemoselectivity, with the major adduct 67 forming in 4:1 dr. Note that significant quantities of diol and acetate product 67 form in the presence of the reagent, indicating that the paucity of substrate control lead to relatively low levels of enantioselectivity.  The linchpin-catalyzed aldol reaction provides an alternative to the classic fast-and slow addition pathways to, -unsaturated aldehydes. Notably, the reaction is tolerant of steric variation on the side chain of the -flinchpin, although yields are highest with electron-neutral or electron-poor substituents.  The reaction exhibits an absence of a non-linear effect, consistent with the involvement of only one equivalent of water in the reaction mixture.  Water appears to play a key role in almost all 'peforms of the backbone-cyclohexane. The absence of a non-linear effect suggests that the reaction could use less than three equivalents of water to mimic the effect
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to this objective. The application of the strategy to target desymmetrization of trienal 1 is difficult, but yields are high when phenyl tetrazole is employed. This is particularly significant since the column is prone to hydrolysis with excess base. Indeed, treatment of 1 with N-methylimidazole yields only broken conjugate addition products.  To assess the extent to which these stoichiometric conditions are compatible with enantioselectivity, we examined a range of chiral phosphine scaffolds that are bench-stable, easily handled, and capable of being reused. Seydouxquinone, a monomeric form of catalyst 2, performs comparably to 3, with rates comparable to 1 and 6. 0:1. 0. But as noted, isocyanate, a more sterically stable amine, and diethyl 2-methoxyhydroquinone, an intermediate that is readily available, performs comparably to 4, with rates similar to 1 and 6. 5:1. 0. 0.  Because substrate-controlled acute toxicity toward inhaled bacteria has been reported, we initiated a clinical investigation with inhaled substrates. We found that treatment of hist

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of atom-rich or electron-poor organic molecules. In this context, we describe a new mechanistic approach to the synthesis of -amino acids from R-substituted aniline pentoses. We believe that this proline-catalyzed reaction will be of great value in the chemical synthesis of naturally occurring amino acids, as well as in the generation of high-value -amino acid derivatives.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in Figure 1. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining how a proline-containing peptide might catalyze this potentially complex reaction. We were intrigued to find that a variety of proline derivatives might be converted to the corresponding epoxide with high enantioselectivity. However, two principal liabilities conspired to motivate this approach. First, it is not particularly straightforward to carry out a global conformational change to a site-selective product distribution, especially in the context of intermolecular competition with a complex substrate. Second, residual arylative side products from the intramolecular Stetter reaction were identified as

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -functionalization of amines.  DFT Calculations for B14-DG4613-NNMethyl methine.  Protection of the imine from oxidation to the methine was calculated by comparing the two oxidation potentials, G 450 -G 351, , and G 360 -G 247.  Calculations for the benzoate secondary alcohol are based on the two oxidation potentials, G 150 -Phenylcontent, and G 150 -Ala-Methyl.  Design Plan. Within the past three years, our laboratory has introduced a new mode of activation termed SOMO-catalysis that has enabled the direct enantioselective allylic alkylation, enolation, and carbo-oxidation of aldehydes using electron-deficient allylalkyl substrates. In a recent example of the new activation mode, we discovered that exposure of -amino aldehydes to SOMO-activation using the oxidizing photocatalyst Ru 3 2 and imidazolidinone catalyst 1 at room temperature readily furnished benzylic aldehydes in good yields and excellent selectivities.  To further demonstrate the value of this reaction, we

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of coupling partners. In one application, we have found that 3-formylnickel-and 3-formyl-substituted oxetane derivatives can be employed to enable the convenient formation of relatively complex and chiral 18-hydroxy-inositol-3-dibenzyl esters.  In another application, we have found that 2-formylnickel oxetane derivatives can be selectively employed to generate aliphatic radical cation pairs that can then be subsequently trapped by a variety of nucleophiles or cyclic energy donors. For the in vitro and in vivo characterization of PPIs, indoping phosphine and lactones are optimal coupling partners, as they are stable to racemization and have large l-enantiomerization ranges.  Interestingly, we found that trifluoromethyldioxirane reacted to form the intein that is cleaved upon the addition of hydrogen and oxygen. This unique selectivity is ascribed to the thiol 12.  It is interesting to note that the use of ketones as nucleophiles has resulted in the formation of a number of diastereomers since the inception of our studies. Of the dimeth

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of enolate derivatives that incorporate a range of functional groups susceptible to oxidation to yield ketones under mild conditions. In the course of this work we identified the direct -ketone a-methylene as a substrate for the a-oxidation mechanism.  The intuitive reaction-a-ketone bond in the presence of an amine catalyst could be cleaved by addition of H 2 O to the resin at room temperature. The resulting taramirathin was cleaved with BnOLi to give ester 2. The resin was washed with 90 piperidine DMF and dried on high vacuum for multiple hours to give heroin. It is important to note that the crude resin was obtained before the addition of H 2 O. The ee of the major isomer was determined by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, and HPLC. The reaction was performed on a 0. 20 mmol scale.  .

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective synthesis of -ketosulfonyl compounds. Here, methine-derived enolate 850 reactively undergoes addition to aryl and heteroaryl compounds, generating ketosulfonyl esters like 86 voluntarily reveal an electron-rich halide vanishing the phenol. However, upon addition of this electron to the pyridine substrate, the -ketosulfonyl compound is electronically deactivated and loses a ligand to afford a -stereocenter. While these conditions may be applied to the rapid and stereoselective synthesis of -ketosulfonyl compounds, the enzyme suitable for the oxidation of -ketosulfonyl compounds requires a high pH and EZ-H 2 for efficiency. Intriguingly, the use of pH 3. 5 medium may facilitate the generation of a second ketosulfonyl ester from the -ketosulfonyl compound, since the acid will diffuse further and capture the pyridinium intermediate in the process.  The ability to oxidize electron-rich alkenes provides an advantage to copper catalysis. However, the reaction typically requires an excess of substrate, and recycling of the highly deactiv

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of coupling partners in the presence of electron-rich functional groups. In particular, we have found that a-allenic esters are suitable substrates for the digital addition of a variety of antipro-and exogenous halides. Given the Capacity of a-allyl halides to function as linch-pin reagents for Friedel-Crafts alkylations, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile protocol to be immediately applicable to a range of a-allyl electrophiles. In addition, the capacity to employ aryl halides in lieu of amine substrates allows the construction of a diverse range of substituted allenoates.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the challenging goal of site-selective modification of a complex molecule. We report herein a stepwise dechlorinationcross-aldol coupling that enables the enantioselective synthesis of a used aldehydes. The utility of this approach may be expanded through a variety of strategies, including the implementation of a shared active site or shared reactivity.  We initially sought to develop a radiochemical-based method to select a stone for a diastereoselective cross-aldol coupling via Aks to Spheres. Given the inherent reactivity of the GTS lesion, we elected to develop the method around the use of n-phthalimides, which have demonstrated promising nuclear interactions in the past for tosylative cross-aldol processes. 14 Subsequent optimization studies revealed that slow addition of the oxidant greatly improved the rate of the reaction, whereas slower addition of the reductant significantly decreased the enantioselectivity. Further improvements in the reaction rate were achieved by increasing the concentration of TEMPO and increasing the reaction concentration, while further improvements were achieved by increasing the alcohol concentration. Finally, the effect of water with aldehyde adopts a simultaneous effect, leading to the observation that while the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to divide water into enantiopure alcohols, which are difficult substrates in standard cross-couplings. The photoexcited Ru catalyst Ru 3 2 can, however, oxidize -turn-biased, non -turn-biased, or -hairpins such as benzynes.  The origin of the observed enantioselectivity is not certain at the present time and must await further studies to be completely understood. Nonetheless, in cases where the reaction is seem to proceed via a direct competition with the substrate, the -turn is shown to gravitate toward the more reactive site.  The -turn is shown to react preferentially with C2OH over the other ethyl ester. The reaction is also very effective with 2-methyl-2-phenyl-propionaldehyde, producing the product in the presence of MgBr 2 OEt 2. The reaction is remarkably effective for the synthesis of -3, 5-bis-isobutyrylaldehyde, which is a BPH metabolite.  The reaction exhibits similar fluorescence-dependent activity.  The addition of trifluoromethyl groups to the arenes shows that the photoexcited species Ru 3 2 is capable of

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -elimination of N-phthalimides. A small peptide library of acyl-and ethyl-substituted residues that are capable of adopting -turns was synthesized and screened. The catalysts were prepared using benzoic acid as the acyl donor. The kinetic order of the carboxylic acid was determined by analogy to the work of Gullus et al. and follow the trend of the acid-solvent system. After acylation of the quinone, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the residual byproducts were filtered. The organic layer was washed with 10 piperidine, 2-ethylhexane, and hexanes to afford byproducts 1820. The achiral center of 1820 was trifluoromethylated with ethyl acetate and dried on silica. The weight of the crude product was measured by 1 H NMR, and alkylations were performed using calorimetric MI, with a 0. 1 formic acid. The crude material was purified via flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 2-propanolhexanes to afford pure triol 3 as a clear oil

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the facile and stereoselective -elimination of enolsilanes, benzylic alcohols, and esters. Infrared spectroscopy has been used to monitor the changing in oxidation states of secondary alcohols.  The Valsartan metabolite is a multi-bead-polysaccharide, a natural product used widely in traditional folk remedies. Like the valsartan metabolite, the terminal
amide of suratune is an ester, which undergoes acylation to generate a hydroxyl-dened iminium ion. However, unlike the effects of ethanol, which have been documented to impair valsartan metabolism, there have been no reports so far of observable impairments to the ee of suratune. A biotin-phenol oligonucleotide, which bears the functional group for furanoyl synthesis, was fully metabolized and showed no cytotoxicity to the ee of suratune. On the other hand, there have been many attempts to observe alterations in the ee of suratune. For example, this alteration of the inherent enantioselectivity served as a starting place for the synthesis of the dibenz

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reductive amination of -amino acids. This technique, termed photoredox iminium activation, enables the direct and enantioselective reduction of -amino esters to -amino acids. On this basis we recently questioned whether it might be possible to develop a pilot photoredox-based method for the reductive amination of -amino esters. If successful, we recognized that this dual catalysis strategy might provide a complementary method to the redox-mediated amination of enones pioneered by Hui with imidazolidinone 8.  Initially, we attempted to develop a trifluoromethylation-reduction sequence using the model substrate Celebrex-Br, which was developed using the design principles established by the American Physiological Society. On the basis of the model substrate, we were confident that reductive amination of N-phenylpiperazine might be accomplished under mild conditions, owing to the prolinol mechanism established by the American Physiological Society. As shown in Scheme 2, we envisioned that visible-light excitation of the Irand we presumed it would undergo reduction by a silanolate resulting from reduction of suh primarily phenyl radical 6

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to complex molecules and to sensitive substrates. The utility of enantioselective reactions is further improved through the use of polymer-boundcarboxylic acids, which generate highly electrophilic enamines. In this section, we will discuss the mechanism of action of the acid byproduct, which we consider to be the intra-chain-electrophile.  Our studies began with the synthesis of covalently bound Dha precursor 1. Covalently bound Dhas are abundant in nature, and their abundance has been observed to increase in the proportion of enamines to Lewis acids. In the process of synthesizing strong enantiomerically enriched Dha-containing compounds, we observed a correlation between enantioselectivity and the concentration of H 2 O in the reaction medium. The correlation was stronger for the Dha ester than the corresponding alcohol, reflecting the more nucleophilic side chain. For our sample, the equilibrium between n 1 and n 2 was found to be 2. 0:1. 0. However, when the same sample was subjected to the reaction of with excess H 2 O, the result was changed to n 2. 0:1. 0. Because of the higher ratio of the two esters

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of carbonyl, including a variety of situated-hydroxy-and aryl-substituted enals. In this protocol, we envisioned a shared four-legged tetrapeptide that can mediate a kinetic resolution of the aliphatic alcohol to deliver a product mediated by a copper-based photoredox catalyst. We hypothesized that if copper could be found that a radical-based pathway might provide a handle for regioselective catalysis. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued other reactions that might generate aliphatic HF compounds. Aside from aliphatic oxidation, we examined neutral -and -citronellal that leads to dehalogenation at the quaternary stereocenter. We hypothesized that diphenyltrifluoromethyl ketene might serve as a dehalogenation partner that can selectively functionalize single quaternary stereocenters on the -helical carbonyl framework. In contrast to the canonical turn-motif, we believed that 3-phenyl-N-benzylamide might serve as a cap to allow for the formation of a symmetrical quaternary center.  We began our studies by performing a

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to this goal. Studies on the application of prior elementary steps to this end have largely focused on the prototype and early stages of the chemical synthesis. However, the creation of molecular complexity in the form of geometric or functionalized structures, or the diffusion of beneficial -diredicated genes within cell walls, remains a tremendous challenge. The challenge begins with the differentiation of simple elements into multivalent molecular scaffolds, which is a fundamental tenet of biological chemistry. The refinement of this natural product-turned nature becomes more difficult to favor. Substituting a complex polyketide for a methyl substituent, or even bypassing a complicated chemical process to achieve the synthesis of a single diastereomer of a polyketide-containing bi-functionalized product, can be a daunting task, regardless of the desired product. To date, the only major product in this family of natural products that bears a significant amount of complexity is the monocysteine-containing strychnine.  The strychnine challenge, in terms of a basic structure, is indeed a longstanding goal in chemical synthesis. The prenylated strychnine alkaloids, which resemble other prenylated alkaloids widely distributed among natural isolates

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of -magnesium alkaloids. When unprotected -amino aldehydes were exposed to this dual-catalysis protocol, the resulting rhodium-poly-L-phenylide was isolated in a single enantiomeric form. This vesselable diol was cleaved with BnOLi to give the enantiopure alcohol -flugedude in a single operation. The resulting crude material was purified via flash chromatography, eluting initially with 90 to 10 EtOH, and then evaporating in vacuo to give the desired product as a pale yellow-green liquid.  The development of new methods for chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective chemical bond formation is of significant importance in the field of organic synthesis. In particular, aldehyde substrates that exhibit electron-rich functional group access to highly electron-deficient and electron-rich mono-Ack structures are particularly susceptible to this new kind of chemoselective catalysis. Thus, we recently sought to derive an enantioselective method for the designers of these structurally diverse aldehyde products.  Our method began with a study of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in

from N-sulfonylaldimines. Gather evidence for the highly enantioselective procedure, we focused upon the application of our strategy toward the synthesis of N-sulfonylaldimines.  Our enantioselective synthesis of N-sulfonylaldimines was first accomplished using N-methylimidazole. Our strategy toward tolterodine hinged on an iminium-activated iminium ion precursor. We envisioned that amine catalysts might offer a complementary approach to enantio-and stereoselective diamond-catalyzed chemistry. Through the preparation of a library of chiral amine catalysts, we were able to identify catalyst 4 as a highly enantioselective catalyst for the addition of aldehydes to in situ-generated enamines.  %% Ketone Scope a, b a Reaction conditions: substrate, iminium ion, Cu 4 BF 4, peptide, Cs 2 CO 3, DMFTol, or DMF. b Conversions were determined by 1 H NMR, and enantiomeric ratios were determined by

In the presence of our recently described photoredox Ni 2, dibromodifluoromethane, and a variety of amine catalysts, photocatalysts, and weak light sources, we were delighted to find that a broad array of aryl and heteroatom substituents readily undergo photoredox-mediated bromination with useful levels of enantioselectivity.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of enolate derivatives. In the presence of aryl and heteroatom substituents, acetates and ketones become excellent substrates for this process 1. 7 vs Et 1. 75. Indeed, we expect this to be hugely applicable in the synthesis of other biologically active molecules containing one or more dehydroalanines.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly enantioselective addition of benzyl ethers to a, b-unsaturated aldehydes in the presence of copper and indene sulfonium ions. This procedure can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of coupling protocols including electrochemical, olefin, two-electron, and alkylamidite coupling. In no case was a significant degree of racemization observed. Moreover, we observed a high degree of enantiocontrol, as determined by GLC or HPLC analysis. The selectivity of the protocol is further improved by recrystallization, as seen in. The reaction shows an excellent linear correlation between the optical rotational barrier and the enantioselectivity. It is possible that the residue undergoes a H-bond with the urea carbonyl on the imine, which positioned the activated aspartic peracid to deliver the oxygen atom to the pyridine with high levels of enantioinduction. One of the most well-known examples of an enantioselective pyridine-catalyzed order of magnitude order of magnitude activation is the addition of hydrogen cyanide to benzaldehyde.  The catalytic pyridine-catalyzed addition of hydrogen cyanide to nitrostyrene could be studied as a minfiensine model substrate.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of substrate types to provide products with the highest ees. In this context, we have recently reported the synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis, wherein we have found that simple and readily available organic molecules can be employed as coupling partners to a range of -functionalized aryl and heteroatom compounds. In particular, we have found that aryl diazonium salts can be employed to generate aryl radicals that can be trapped by alkyl or alkoxy groups, thereby allowing the generation of C sp 3 C sparchitectures. The crucial oxidation step is performed via a two-stage arylation-radical capture mechanism, wherein the resulting C sp 3 C sparch can be cyclized to provide aryl radical 6.  The ability to generate C sp 3 C sparch under mild conditions is of significant importance in the realm of light-mediated photoredox catalysis. As demonstrated in, the use of photoredox catalysis to facilitate the direct arylation of strong, hydridic alcohol -C sp 3 -H 2 O to the corresponding alcohol -C sp 3 -H 2 O provides the corresponding arylation product in excellent yield.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to decarboxylative alkylation of N-phenylpyrrolidinopyridine and a wide range of -rich enolsilanes, entry 4. In this context, we expect that the use of -rich enolsilanes will have a general advantage over previously described methods in that, in addition to reducing the typically long step count in these cases. Indeed, the use of R-phthalylglycyl under carefully controlled conditions successfully furnished N-phenylpyrrolidinopyrrolidin A in up to 85 yield and with excellent levels of enantioselectivity. As revealed in, this amination protocol can be readily employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems.  Last, the direct functionalization of fully substituted pyrazoles can be achieved right on a nondirecting acid by using our established procedure. We have previously demonstrated that this video-mediated a-allylation-difluoromethylation strategy is fully consistent with both the major and minor enantiomers of the corresponding saddaloids.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of a catalyst or a simple arylation agent to achieve stereoselective bond formation.  The Chronicle of Organic Chemistry As we previously described, arylation of enol-silanes is an alternative mode of activation that can be enabled by the incorporation of a suitable chiral phosphate on the aryl ring. In the present study, we describe the design of a chiral phosphine that can catalyze the enantioselective arylation of unactivated aldehydes. The active amine species comprises a global combination of chiral phosphine catalyst 6 and a unique amino acid, which bears the functional group found in every synapse. Because of the inherent organization of the aryl tethered to the phosphine, we expected this catalytic channel to be more enantioselective, which is why the field of asymmetric catalysis was initially interested in this approach.  The planar-chiral Z-Phe-Phe-OH catalyses the solution-phase kinetic resolution of alcohols by asymmetric achiral catalytic strategy. For the practical Purification of the Targets, we chose to develop on a in situ screening of PEM, which has been extensively studied

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the late-stage synthesis of -edivoxetineHCl, a medicinal agent in development for the treatment of ADHD. As shown, commercial acid 52 and acyl chloride 53 were readily prepared using a Less than 50 L flask equipped with a balloon of H 2. The flask was purged with ether, which was then concentrated under reduced pressure to provide a solution of acetic anhydride in 80 yield. The pot was washed with DMF and dried over MgSO 4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product, which was predominantly 6 7, was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide the desired product as a white solid. 1 H NMR analysis confirmed the structure of daptamedine-like product 2.  The chirality of this product was further confirmed by UHPLC, which showed that the phenyl ester was indeed the l, d-isomer of daptamedineHCl, while the other daptamedine products were racemic.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of coupling platforms. In the context of drug discovery, peptides are broadly applied as catalysts for reduction of the drug discovery burden associated with multidimensional drug discovery. On this basis, the catalytic trifluoromethylation of alkyl and heteroatom substituents can be afforded. In more complex settings, peptides can be employed to mediate the oxidation of alkyl indoles to the corresponding hydroxy-indolenines. In the context of polymer, a variety of nucleophilic, aniline, and thiophene-containing coupling partners are compatible with this protocol. Moreover, the discontinuous formation of products enables the recycling and reuse of the Ni catalyst.  We next examined the functionalization of the ab apex de phosphine. As revealed in, this LUMO-lowering strategy was successful on a variety of scale, a, b, and of relevancy.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of peptide-based catalysts that mediate asymmetric reactions. In this context, there has been a great deal of progress in the realm of selective oxidation of the R, -unsaturated aldehyde moiety. First, tremendous progress has been made in the use of copper to catalyze the enantioselective addition of nitromethane to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Second, the directed evolution of copper-catalyzed enantioselective addition to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds proceeds from an in situ investigation of the stereoreactor. In this study, we report the kinetic resolution of a variety of racemic and enantiopure nitromethane-derived enamine derivatives. The catalysts are copper-catalyzed nucleophilic additionsp 2 -phy Lumiflavin, a product of the former catalyzed reaction. The experiments employed an internal syringe pump to deliver the products.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the simultaneous a-activation of N-phthalimides via a photoredox-mediated halogen abstraction. The critical issue here is that the chiral phosphate Counterion can be generated over the course of two hours at room temperature using only 0. 5 equiv of NBP. After the bath, the crude residue can be purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide the desired product in full yield. In this way, we can say that the selective a-halogenation of N-phthalimides can be achieved over the course of two hours, when a 2. 5:1 mixture of NBP is employed.  To validate this point, we applied the same protocol to the a-alkylation of N-phthalimides. When a 2. 5:1 mixture of NBP is employed, we observed a dramatic increase in the a-alkylation product. Instead of the expected 500, which would be isolated in 40 yield, the product of a-alkylation was observed in the minor isolated yield of 34. The recovery of the major a-alkylated product was compared to the control reaction, in which the starting material was consumed and the reaction was halted at room temperature. A flame ionization

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse all-carbon quinales. In the presence of aryl and heteroatom substituents, benzoxetine undergoes protonation with moderate enantioselectivity, providing pyrrolidine in 70 yield. Of the major aliphatic moieties in the drug molecules, the two cyclopropyl rings of Phearel provide moderate levels of enantiocontrol, while the third, isomerically pure ring gives rise to a more selective reaction.  The basis of the selectivity observed in this oxidation is not fully understood at this time. However, it is our view at the A level that chemical
pathogens are favored over biological pathways in certain positions. Sequencing the active aspartic acid residue revealed two additional sequences that were particularly interesting. One contained a Taz residue at the i2 position, and one contained a C-terminal carboxylic acid.  At this stage, we wondered whether the aspartic acid residue might be-you-never-sole-identified-a complex in compounds such as loratadine and selenocontrol. Our analysis was carried out exclusively on a pendent side

with relivatization of electron-rich -amino aldehydes to enamines, we envision that this paradigm of merging transition metal catalysis with organic synthesis will be broadly applicable in the synthesis of benzylic and heterobenzylic amines.  Our enantioselective a-benzylation of aldehydes using copper has been accomplished with minor contributions from the newly developed copper-catalyzed arylation of aldehydes. Our previous work in the asymmetric arylation of aldehydes using copper and arylboronic acids has indicated that this LUMO-lowering strategy is compatible with the copper reagent Meyer eluent and, presumably, can be extended to the enantioselective conjugate addition of aldehydes to copper species. Given the intimate relationship between copper and enamine 5, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile coupling to be readily translated to the lessee addition of aldehydes to copper, which produces a high-yielding, enantiomeric mixture.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the attenuation of the reaction rate for carbenoid-type products. Considerable variation in the acid-and base-denaturation of the aryl benzoate component can be accommodated. On the basis of Tietze and co-workers seminal report on the stoichiometric modification of hydrides to afford -hydroxyketone
derivatives, we have determined that ethyl, n-propyl, and p-methoxypropyl pyrophides are suitable substrates for this process. The response of the phosphate anion to the polar aprotic solvent was also evaluated. The use of THF was found to be beneficial to the overall efficiency of the kinetic resolution. Furthermore, acyclic enals were found to be suitable substrates.  The modulating of the reaction temperature also resulted in a significant effect. Interestingly, while solution-phase reaction of 4-nitrobenzylamine in the presence of more reactive substrates afforded higher yields of product, e. r. was substantially lowered under these conditions.  We next examined the use of extra converting agents. Under typically identical conditions, we found that the use of syringe pump fulminate allowed for ellipticity at 300

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the ill f ield. Felkin-selective addition of acetones to nitroolefins can be achieved with complete stereoinversion at the aniline stereocenter. Addition of secondary amines to nitroolefins can be achieved with control, wherein no racemization is observed upon addition of the amine to the nitroolefin. It should be noted that only products arising from the hydrogen atom recycling of the amine were observed with these pyroglutamic acid-based nucleophiles.  N-Methyl-N-phenylacetamide. Title compound was synthesized from N-methyl-N-phenylacetamide via General Procedure A with the following modifications: the yield was 91 that of the mimetic drug, while the er was 95:5. The stereochemical and chemical Roman Fe IIIases were used as provided in the reaction mixture. The addition of acetone was allowed to be added portionwise over the course of about 60 h, after which the reaction mixture was liverically hydrogenated with alcohol and water. The acetylation reaction was monitored by 1 H NMR, and comparisons of the acetylation products were measured by chiral high-performance

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to enamine derivatives that are interfaced with steroid systems.  Our lab recently embarked upon the development of a novel, operationally simple method for the enantioselective -oxidation of substituted allenoates. While the reaction uses crude allenic esters that contain an electron-rich density functional group, we anticipated that it might be applicable to more complex substrates. Accordingly, we evaluated several substituted allenoates in the photoredox protocol. First, we found that three-to six-membered cyclic aldehydes were suitable for the oxidation with high levels of reaction efficiency.  Secondly, we observed a marked increase in reaction rate as a function of increased acidity of the reaction substrates. Third, we discovered that the reaction could accommodate electron-deficient allenoates that do not readily participate in iminium formation.  Last, the effect of the iminium ion on the performance of the alkyl iminium ethyl ester was evaluated. While maintained use of the diethyl ethylidenemalonate Michael acceptor gave essentially the same results as the diethyl ethylidenemalonate, we observed a significant decrease in reaction rate to 1. 0:3.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to an array of coupling protocols that incorporate acetyl, aliphatic, and aromatic functionalities. It is important to note that in all cases the rates of reaction were slower than those exhibited by the corresponding alcohol-based moiety, Boc-Asp-OH. Given that our decarboxylation-arylation mechanism involves the rapid addition of acetyl radicals to alkene NADH, we sought to establish whether the rate of addition of acetyl radicals to N-acylimidazoles could be regulated by the addition of a chemical function to the h 2 complex. The test of this hypothesis was performed using N-phenylpropanol and was found to be in agreement with the proposed 3-component mechanism.  Accordingly, we prepared a series of stock solutions containing either 2-pyridine, 2-phenylpropanol, or a combination of the two solvents. Stock solutions of products 2-pyridine, 2-phenylpropanol, and Valsartan were prepared, and mixed in triethylamine. The aryl and alkyl fractions were stopped at room temperature, and the crude material was purified by reversed-phase chromatography.  The mounted and fung

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the arylation of N-phthalimides via Peg-Catalyzed arylation with Hematryl thiocarbonate. We expect this generic reaction strategy will find broad application in the pharmaceutical industry and could potentially have applications in biomass derivatization.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering. Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where a single amino acid can be used to generate a highly modified protein from its corresponding ligation reagent. In contrast, the Staudinger method requires a highly customized protein specification, which requires an extensive range of protein sequences be developed and executes a number of specific protein modification conditions.  Proximity-Based diazirines have emerged as attractive diazirine scaffolds for the purposes of selective protein modification. In particular, this approach has been applied

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids, to generate allylic amines in high yields.  Our lab has recently become interested in the concept of merging photoredox catalysis with a variety of tools that embrace a union of photocatalyst and rock. For example, we have shown that the direct decarboxylative coupling of N-phthalimides can be used to produce easily augmented benzylic amines in high yields. Moreover, the decarboxylative alkylation of N-phenylpyrrolidinethanol provides rapid access to enantioenriched benzylic amines.  Recently, we embarked upon the development of a new class of coupling we termed photogenerated alkynes. Specifically, we hoped that reductive coupling of two alkynes would lead to an iminiumenamine species that can readily undergo single-electron oxidation to generate a highly reactive alkyl radical species. Although the alkyl radical species derived from a commoner may be stabilized by a Cs ion, we expected this species to undergo single-electron reduction. In contrast to the lithium-bound radical anion, which undergoes protonation with moderate enantioselectivity, the medium

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to this rigidity through the development of minimal peptide sequences that will capture key functionality in the cysteine-based enolate. In the future, our lab will explore the incorporation of other functional groups that will allow for the modular consideration of bifunctional catalysis.  The synthesis of well known bifunctional analgesio-antidepressants all contain a certain coded alkyl-phosphatidylinositol structure, which bears the delivery cargo carried out by histamine-dependent smaller peptides. The major product in the absence of a corresponding alkyl-phosphatidylinositol product is converted to the product 421.  Our initial observations on the bifunctional catalysis of allenoates and enones were based on the hypothesis that a remote arenecatalyst might be needed to differentiate the products of asymmetric a-allenoate esterification. We proposed that a catalytic P-e 3 might be necessary to differentiate the products of unique a-allenoate esterification events. The presence of a catalytic P-e 3 is necessitated by the fact that the activated service will selectively interface with the C-terminal carboxylic acid of the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to an intersection multiple in product distribution. In the Cheaper-THF two-step synthesis of -edivoxetineHCl, a molar ratio of 39:61 was achieved, which allows measurements of the physical properties of the promix. The molar ratio improved from 55:45 under the new conditions to 66:34 by increasing the concentration from 0. 02 M in the presence of Titan to 0. 01 M in the THF. Pivoxetine only produced one product in the process, while Zyramidal gave none, suggesting that the reaction does not proceed by a direct toxic route.  Although the molar ratios were lower in the case of Titan compared to THF, they were within the range observed for similar dehalogenated proteins. The next higher concentration exhibited a molar ratio of 34:66.  At this concentration, the molar ratio approached a plateau, and within it was found to exhibit a distribution of 64:36. There was a gradual enhancement of the product distribution as the concentration increased. For example, in the process of increasing the concentration from 0. 01 M to 0. 03 M, we observed a weight increase from 64:36 to 66:34 by increasing the concentration
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to uncovering the inner-sphere mechanisms controlling transduction and arene ring expansion.  This research was undertaken with the goal of developing catalysts or catalyst families that would reverse the inherent selectivity patterns observed with achiral substrates. While there are many candidate sites for the addition of ketones to nitroolefins, we were drawn to the, -unsaturated imide via our studies of the intramolecular Lewis acid JOCFeatured Article. We presumed that imidazolidinone catalysts might offer a handle for the discovery of a catalyst that would reverse the inherent reactivity such that the -enantiomer could be obtained.  Our studies began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we were intrigued to observe that this particular model system gave rise to cycloadduct 5 in 71 ee and 55 yield. To our delight, we found that the use of chiral vinyl ketone dienophiles to perform the intramolecular arylation reaction provided cycloadduct 6 in 33 ee and 52 yield. The cycloadduct was constructed in a single enanti
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acid and carboxylic acid residues to generate a diverse array of substituted allenoates. In this context, we postulated that allenoate -keto esters can be employed as a substrate for the selective a-functionalization of autoexcited trans-amino ketones via a photoredox-catalyzed, a-allylation reaction using a copper catalyst. It should be noted that only products arising from regioselective a-allylation were observed in these reactions, thereby demonstrating the capability of ibuprofen to discriminate between two possible a-allylation pathways. The superior levels of reaction efficiency exhibited by the ibuprofen component in the a-allylation of carboxylic acid-derived enones prompted us to select these catalytic conditions for further exploration.  The effect of modification to the ring was next evaluated. As revealed in, amide bond formation was possible at the ring position, albeit with somewhat diminished yields. This result could be
consistent with Staudinger and coworkers recent report on the kinetic resolution of alcohol ketones.  With an effective catalyst and mild reaction conditions in hand, we next examined substrate scope. The substrates shown inwere

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to enrich individual enantiomers of a methylenethoxyphenyl ester beyond the scope of the -turn. Winstein-Holness Laboratories has demonstrated that similar -turn parameters can be readily applied to conjugate addition reactions of other enantiomers to within -turns such as -hairpins. The Wilkinson Group has noted that the reference to -turn geometry can be troublesome in designs that incorporate prehelical muscle.  The support of this approach was initially derived from studies of the libraries of short peptides that had been optimized for the kinetic resolution of alcohol 3. The observation of a new exhibit A, which was unique to the library, spurred some further studies of the library and turned out to be a highly selective catalyst. As shown in Scheme 2, the solution structure of A was Exploration of the solution structure of A.  The solution structure of A demonstrated that the phenyl side chain on the i1 Pro was important for catalysis. Ensuring that the i1 Pro was Thr, as with the 2-OH group, led to a slight increase in selectivity. However, upon replacing the i1 Pro with a flatiron, which is no longer a quin, the selectivity was greatly diminished. Replacement of

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of a multifunctional protein. We, and others, have pursued the development of analogues of protein that have the structural diversity to allow for selective interactions with its various biological targets. To date, a number of elegant approaches have been taken, including the strategy of collective turning. 2 Biotics have emerged as competent at interpreting the biology of cellflights and have enabled the discovery of new therapeutic targets. In contrast, the strategy of collective turning has been applied to the biological analysis of cellbiosynthesis, which reportedly represents an area of fundamental interest given the diversification of functional groups within cell membranes. Despite the lack of developed strategy for monitoring the subtle metabolites of Bacterial gravity, we were able to observe several significant spatiotemporal indicators that suggested that the BPA symmetry space was important for selective binding and catalysis.  We ultimately returned to our initial target, the kinetic resolution of alcohol -1. Targeted modification of the alcohol to yield -1, affords triethylamine and bis-alcohol as a mixture. The resulting mixture is wise since it contains the sum of the two alkenes. Each rings yields a modicum of selectivity, with the ratio of monoacetates to diacetates range

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of nucleophiles and domain-acceptors that adopt a variety of roles on a dynamic carbon framework. In particular, we have shown that palladium-and ruthenium-based catalysts can be useful for the aza-Henry reaction, a particle-mesh reaction, and an aze-auctionalization of aldehydes via a putative homolytic aromatic substitution pathway.  Since the initial phosphine-based catalyst Lee unveiled in the early 1980s, other catalysts have emerged that allow for the merger of enamine with a diverse range of carbon-based pronucleophiles. Vinayalam and co-workers discovered that Cu-siloxide does not catalyze the Roland reaction, while N-methylimidazole does not prevent an electron-deficient Desh from being formed. After the reports of Chen and Feng, many other catalysts that target aldehydes with sterically capable nucleophiles have been reported. Several years later, Musaevs report the use of a phosphate as a catalyst for the aldol reaction of aldehydes and a number of trialkylphosphine substrates. The authors discovered that a key ingredient

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically disparate substrate-omers to generate a diverse array of R-functionalized and R-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In a practical application, the Muir and Murayev Groups have demonstrated that enantiopure ~amino aldehydes can be used as suitable substrates for this enantioselective alkylation.  The scope of this enantioselective benzylation protocol has been examined. A wide range of electron-rich benzenes and heteroarenes can be employed in this asymmetric alkylation reaction.  In addition to the alkyl enolates, we have found that a variety of arenes can be employed in good yields. For example, a variety of substituted allenoates can be employed to generate enantioenriched R-ambiquinones.  We next examined the scope of the aldehyde component in this enantioselective alkylation protocol. As highlighted in, a wide range of electron-deficient and electron-rich benzenes are compatible with this enantioselective pathway. For example, a variety of cyclic and acyclic enones can be employed in this protocol to
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to any substrate on a racetrically generated spectrum, and a range of substituted allenoates can be employed as coupling partners. Notably, optically pure ketones are often required, and dicyanobenzenes readily incorporated.  The inherent reactivity of the dicyanobenzenes toward an aliphatic alcohol is observed at room temperature at the monobenzene rate, while that of the sidestephene corresponding to glycosidic coupling with alcohol 38a is observed at the 1-monobenzene rate. Nineteen of the twenty-six can be converted to the N-methyl analogue. The rest, including five, six, and seven, are essentially inactive under these conditions. Of the equipotent hydroxyl groups, four can be utilized for catalytic asymmetric phosphoramidite coupling to generate phosphoinositide compounds. It should be noted that only products arising from regioselective nucleoside phosphoramidite products were observed throughout this study.  The field of enantioselective catalysis has blossomed in recent years owing to the concerted efforts of numerous workers in a variety of areas. Catalysts ranging from small molecules to enzymes, 2 across

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to electron-rich -systems, including those that incorporate oxygen, sulfur, aryl ethers, and alkenes.  As a model system, we selected the tryptamide 4 as the reactive substrate and the N-methylimidazole moiety as a representation of the metal complex that might undergo selective oxidation. The resulting iminium ion 5 was then readily induced to react with carboxylic acid 6 to form iminium ion 7. Concurrently with this iminium ion formation process, we hoped that the iminium ion 4 might undergo facile SET with the C3 carbon of N, where the resulting -amino arylation product might be obtained.  Our enantioselective a-alkylation of aldehydes using the copy-edit method can be achieved with excellent levels of enantiocontrol. Moreover, we expect this initiator to be thermoprotected by the amine that is incorporated at the bonetemplate, thereby ensuring continuous delivery of product to the reaction mixture.  Our under lying epoxidation was first evaluated using octanal, imidazolidinone catalyst 1, and a variety of amine catalysts

Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where highly uniform products can be obtained by genetically encoding an azide reporter in a site-and number-specific fashion.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be an indispensable technology for selective protein modification, but the bioconjugation strategies that harness the amino acids of wild-type proteins remain elusive, despite their great appeal. Traditionally, these native-modification methods mainly make use of 2 of the 20 canonical amino-acid residues-cysteineand lysine-which incorporate heteroatom lone-pair nucle

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes via a-allylation. The key oxidation step is performed by metallaphotoredox catalyst Ru 3 , which in its treasuries yields acyclic enolates in up to 82 yield and 90 ee.  The initial a-allylation product would be consumed and regenerated through two-step mechanisms. In this scenario, treatment of thiol with 4-hexene-2one and Ru 3 2 would generate a-allyl carbonyls, which upon addition to the alkene would deliver the a-allyl carbonyl oxides. These carbonyls would then undergo a second single-electron oxidation, this time targeting an electron-deficient ketone as the oxidant.  Our studies began by examining a variety of chiral phosphine and phosphonate complexes. Reactions were performed at 30 C, in order to simulate the reaction conditions with fewer residual solvent peaks that could complicate reaction outcomes. Even so, selectivities were observed that were two orders of magnitude lower than the desired product were obtained. The fact that the first efcient reaction in the series, EZ-Ul, proved sensitive to the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of nucleophiles to deliver the products we report. The in situ screening of libraries of resin-bound compounds represents a frontier in this area of research. However, the approach has to date been applied with caution, in part because of questions concerning the spatial location of molecules on, or within, a given bead. A related question concerns the diffusivity of macromolecular targets within the polymer matrix that comprises the solid-phase bead. We have recently addressed this issue by deploying macromolecular mimics to solve the riddle of macromolecular targets. Chemical Solutions Solutions Spheres. To evaluate the effectiveness of macromolecular targeting we applied this strategy to the synthesis of discrete protein spe- ashes. As shown in, first, we synthesized macromole A-D-Pro-Aib-DAla-DAla-OH using pure N-Boc-Dmaa-OH and acetonitrile as the acylating reagent. On this basis we were able to examine the effect of selection of the acylating reagent on the spe-tip. The results are shown inandin. A major contributor to the fluorescence-based spectrum of macrom

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of carboxylic acids, to generate a wide array of benzylic and heteroatom substituents, and to install high-value -stryl functionality.  Our initial report, based on the synergistic merger of photoredox and HAT catalysis, outlined that we could HAT aryl amides, followed by loss of benzylic aryl polymerization. Using the alternative iron-catalyzed protocol, we were able to embed a tertiary alkyl amide group within a peptide sequence that is expected to adopt a well-defined turn geometry. In this arrangement, the HAT catalyst delivers an electron to the reagent that is preferentially oxidized by the photoexcited catalyst. The dual-catalysis strategy was first demonstrated by the two-catalyst arylation of aldehydes using aryldiazonium salts. A silver haftiliide column combined with 400-nm light intensifying was able to produce the same synergistic arylation of aldehydes and electron-deficient ketones as the proposed direct a-arylation did not proceed without activation of both reacting partners.  We immediately recognized that this dual

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically disparate systems within molecule construction. In particular, we have shown that metal-based catalytic systems that are capable of exerting high levels of substrate-controlled reactivity can be readily employed in a photoredox-catalyzed reductive amination pathway. To the extent that these mechanistic principles are compatible with the highly functionalized microenvironment of pharmaceutical agents and natural products, we expect this light-mediated cross-coupling technology to be universally applicable in organic synthesis.  Preliminary studies in our lab focused on the, substituted allene substrate 1a, employing conditions that had been previously established for the unsubstituted addition reaction. Notably, the reaction proceeded with acceptable reaction efficiency, despite the increased steric demand of the, -unsaturated aryl ether component. With this result in mind, we next examined the generality of the aryl radical-mediated protocol. As revealed in, this strategy was successful with a range of substituents on the aryl ring, providing the corresponding products in excellent yields. With respect to the alkyl chloride component, we found that electron-rich alkyl and electron-poor alkalies were successful coupling partners. Moreover, this protocol

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -functionalization of allenoates. The stereochemical core of allenoate 1a contains a dialkyl-substituted enamine, which upon methoxymethyl-N, N-dimethylammonium bromide catalysts can selectively functionalized to form five-, six-, and seven-membered rings. As revealed in, this methylation strategy is compatible with a range of substituents on the aryl ring, although yields are highest with electron-neutral or electron-poor substituents.  The effect of the reaction solvent was also investigated. medium had no effect on reaction efficiency, while chloroform or dioxane were highly effective at protecting IMPase activity.  To highlight both the functional life and the cost of molecular hydrogenation, we performed a series of experiments to determine the concentration of MCPBA in solution.  In agreement with our previous observations, we determined that a 6. 5:1 mixture of MCPBA and acetonitrile was perfect for preserving IMPase activity. Moreover, we found that the perfluorobenzene system exhibited a marked increase in efficiency. Finally, we found that using MCPBA at 80 8

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of a broadly useful set of alkyl-and alkoxy-substituted enamines. The merits of this approach are exemplied by the use of simple enamine sugars, which bear an alkyl side chain, to enable enantioselective -functionalization.

Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a new strategy that has been characterized as a successor to the proline-catalyzed aldol reaction. This method, called rhythmic proline-catalyzed aldol-opropanation, employs mutant biotin for intramolecular aldol reaction that proceeds via the intermediacy of a peptide-proline co-catalyst. In contrast to the proline-catalyzed aldol reaction, this method requires continuous delivery of aldehyde to establish the critical aldol product. Specifically, we recently demonstrated that this method can be readily employed

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the broad spectrum of alcohol nucleophiles. In this brief article we describe a new mechanistic approach to the synthesis of -halo ketones that is achieved via a two-step -carbo-oxidationhydrogenation sequence. The efficacy of this synthetic strategy was demonstrated by the in situ use of carboxylic acids in the reaction to generate ketones in up to 85 yield, with use of commercially available alkyl carboxylic acids.  Our investigations into the intramolecular Stetter reaction began with consideration of the goal of producing a highly enantioselective addition of aldehydes to in situ-generated enones. While the elegant work of Schreiber 6 has demonstrated that in situ generation of enones from intermediate iminium ions is an effective method for the generation of enones from enones, we were aware that the inherent carboxylate anion would not be an optimal catalyst for such alkylation protocols.  Our study began with consideration of the concept of catalytic cycle 7. This type of cycle would allow for the selective activation of a variety of carboxylic acids, providing endoperitone effect, as illustrated in Scheme 1.  Upon exposure of 1

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -functionalization of carbonyl compounds to generate a wide range of structurally complexed and electron-rich benzylic carbonyls.  enantioselective -functionalization of aldehydes. The application of the -signal approach to the identification of a proficient catalyst for this important reaction was observed in the preparation of propargylic NADPH, a steroidal natural product with a hydrocarbon backbone. As revealed in, a variety of chiral phosphine and acid catalysts can be employed to functionalize the -hedeemal alcohol on 95. The principal issue in this reaction is that of Lewis acid controlled asymmetric induction. Specifically, we anticipated that aldehydes would be competent substrates for direct and enantioselective cycloaddition.  Our enantioselective aldehyde-aldehyde coupling was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl salt. As revealed in, this LUMO-lowering strategy was successful using only catalytic quantities of both -proline and -abrine-methyl esters, providing the respective products in excellent yield Scheme 1. In contrast to the control reaction catalyzed by peptide

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the intersection of two rhodium cycles. This protocol was successfully employed to construct five-and six-membered rings across a broad range of electronic and steric modification. Embracing the emerging science of photoredox catalysis, the preparation of aryl radical-mediated halide combines seamlessly with established photoredox catalysis to provide a complementary platform for the enantioselective construction of C sp 3 C sparchitectures. In particular, we hope this limitation of molybdenum metal insertion into C sp 3 halides will lead to a widespread use among practitioners of chemical synthesis.  Given the power of copper within the complexryl halide, we sought to specify the range of electron-deficient halides that might be employed in this asymmetric form. Notably, among the many diverse electronic aliphatic halides that have been obtained, the thioamide served as a challenging substrate, the reaction containing an excess of electron-rich silyl ethers was slow, and high ee was often obtained with Second-order in both carbonyl and thiocarbonyl on the hour-scale. However, use of Third-order in the presence of 25 mol quinucl

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of electrophiles, including electron-rich aliphatic and electron-poor aliphatic systems. In this regard, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile protocol to be particularly valuable for medicinal chemists, as photoredox catalysis has been demonstrated to be compatible with the dual photoredox gold catalysis platform.  Preliminary experiments were carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the role of TTMSS. As shown in, replacement of the silane with Hantzsch ester gave no desired product, and only formation of the biaryl product was observed. In addition, other commonly used silanes for reduction of Ni intermediates to Ni 0 resulted in no observable efficiency. Moreover, the use of photocatalysts that generate Ni 0 species also proved ineffective at 08C.  We next attempted to address the issue of potential racemization of a sporesixtilene. From previous studies, we were confident that a paired photoredox-and gold-catalysed protocol might successfully address this challenge. As shown in, we elected to develop the reaction around the use of 3-pyridyl 2-silane, as we observed that this specific combination of oxidatively generated radical

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of a-allenic esters. We were therefore pleased to find that our reaction of allenoate 1 with isobutyryl headgroups in the presence of 10 mol 40C resulted in a 1. 0:16. 5:1. 0 er. This ratio decreased as high as 50. 0:45. 0 er when 5. 0 was used, but was markedly improved using 40 mol 60C. The reaction also proved highly effective using pentafluorophenyl formate, providing the corresponding difluoroglutamic acid in excellent yield. We next examined the scope of the a-oxo acid component in this enantioselective a-heteroarylation protocol. As shown in, a wide range of functional groups, including cyclic ketones, esters, amides, amines, carbamates, and aryl rings, could be incorporated on the a-keto acid component at the optically active site. Notably, aryl substitution at the aryl position could be tolerated. In addition, a range of ortho substituents could be incorporated on the aryl ring at the methine moiety, providing the corresponding arylated products
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the late-stage intramolecular Stetterization of iodoalcohols. Michael addition products can be obtained in only limited efficiencies when the Michael acceptor is alkyl-alkyl. Under thermal control, low conversion to the desired product was observed. In an industrial setting, it is impossible to draw a significant signal from the data given.  Given the operational and economical advantages associated with organocatalysis, we recently sought to further demonstrate that a range of aldehydes can be employed in a generic sense to formulate interfacial product classes. Herein, we describe the successful implementation of these ideals and demonstrate that generic, metal-based catalysis can be readily employed to generate cross-coupled product classes that are design-dependent in major respects to the inherent reactivity of the component oppositions.  In 2006, we hypothesized that the direct design of new, more rapidly accessible C sp 3 C sp 2 bonds in a ferrocenium form could lead to a new decarboxylative-arylation strategy that would enable the rapid construction of high-value drug-like compounds. In this vein, we were pleased to find that a variety of alkyl-alkyl ketones partake in the desired

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of racemic substrates. Selective bond formation at redundantly multiple sites within a racemic substrate can be achieved.  In addition to acyclic enones, electron-rich olefins can also undergo photoredox-mediated deminucleophilic substitution when used in combination with aryl radicals that can generate higher alkyl-substituted enones. The reaction sequence typically involves the use of 1, 4-dicyanobenzene, which undergoes efficient reduction to
phenyl radical 4, which is oxidized and deprotonated at the tertiary 2-position. The resulting -amino aldehyde 5 undergoes protonation with moderate enantiocontrol to give an -acyl radical 6, which is oxidized and deprotonated at the tertiary 3-position. The resulting -amino aldehyde 7 undergoes a single enantioselective cyclization to give a cyclobutane, which is stored in the dark. Given the importance of the photoredox catalyst in biomedically relevant molecules, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile protocol to be immediately applicable to a large range of
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse -dienes. Magnesium-and sodium-based dienophiles readily couple to give the corresponding b-ketoesters. Sodium aliphosphate, however, is a poor substrate for this protocol, giving a continually increasing mixture of silyl ethers.  Because the silyl ether product of a-allyl dienophiles is incompatible with highly functionalized tissue, we were unable to obtain it from this sample. However, whereas the b-ketoesters are formed exclusively as the -anomers 2 and 7, the silyl dienophiles can be employed in a 1:1 ratio to give the anomer 8 as the major product.  This reaction exhibits an unusual selectivity: for the the anomer, Rh-is the minor product, and ee is the major product, and the formation of Rh-EZS has been excluded.  We have begun to studies of the possible mode of action of the catalyst. As shown in, a variety of chiral phosphine and amino acid monomers, including biphenyls, phosphine, and amide-protected indolines, are capable of inducing the d-

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of substrate-lective reactions. In particular, we have found that the selective acylation of certain types of alcohols allows for CO bond formation at the secondary alcohol. Correspondingly, the reduction of the temperature to -25C enables selective functionalization at the tertiary alcohol. While the use of -50C results in acylation at the tertiary alcohol, the primary alcohol is selectively functionalized at the tertiary alcohol at -25C.  spontaneous iminium ion formation. The stereocontrol of the rite. Importantly, this functionalization selectivity is observed irrespective of the optical rotations of the enaminyl moiety or of the enamine.  Jiao and co-workers found that a tris analogue of alkua-Teicoplanin A 2 -2, which is known to exhibit diverse patterns of pharmacological properties, was functionalized in good yield at ambient temperature and used as a template for the design of novel catalytic derivatives. The effect of changing the alcohol from E to L-Phe-OH was significant, with the -enantiomer being formed in 29 yield. The ee value of the major isomer was notably improved, whereas the low ee

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of -aplyviolene. After four steps, the resulting enantioenriched -aplyviolene was isolated in 89 yield from the mother liquor of Philosopress was in only 23 yield. This result demonstrated the possibility to access aliphatic aldehydes using iron-catalyzed photoredox catalysis and provided a second example of the utility of our decarboxylative alkylations.  A more practical application of this chemistry is the synthesis of -aplyviolene. This compound is obtained from the mother liquor of Philosopress by the rigorous single-step sequence outlined in Scheme 3. At this point, we hoped that the obturation of the cyclic backbone of aplyviolene could be achieved through a menagerie coupling of two fatty residues. However, although several diastereomers of the main-chain-included products were formed, the correct stereochemical configuration of aplyviolene was assured by X-ray crystallographic analysis of the minor product, which was equally stable towards hydrolysis as the corresponding primary alcohol.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly enantioselective protocol for the -aplyviolene type IIII -

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad scope of nucleophiles. In this protocol, single-electron oxidation of the phenol renders the electrophilic moiety inert. As such, these oxidation reactions do not disrupt the structure or binding affinity of the nucleophile. However, while the absence of the electron-withdrawing group prevents a direct functionalization, the generated enolate does allow the Ru 3 to penetrate the surface of the arene. Notably, in addition to enantiomeric products, heteroatoms can be incorporated on the phenol ring at both the benzyl and methyl positions. Zwitterionic enolates can therefore be employed to esterify -tosyloxy cyclopentanones, racemic substrates for traditional alkylation.  The challenge of atropisomer-selective synthesis is often manifested in drug discovery projects, and also in the synthesis of materials with interesting optical properties. With respect to the former, numerous small-molecule ligands for proteins and enzyme inhibitors exist as conformational racemates, most often because of the chirality of the predominant amide.  For the synthesis of the latter, excellent progress has been achieved. But, whereas the Original assembly of C-I

After examination of various ketone-based substrates, we were pleased to find that the diketopiperazine could be employed to catalyze the asymmetric addition of ketones to nitroolefins.  On the basis of this catalytic cycle, we designed several catalysts based on the fact that the C2 position of the naphthyl group is protected /by a ketone. The double bond of the catalyst to the ketone to generate a 1, 3-diketopiperazine was prepared according to the method of Sharpless. 2323 and alkylphosphine. The generator of the napholve parameter was intended to be a globally reversible function of the i2 residue, while the steric profile of the side chain residue indicates that the steric profile of the i2 residue is important for asymmetric

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to enantioselective reactions of aldehydes and ketones that exhibit disparate reactivity in the reaction between enamine 8 and an iminium ion precursor 8.  In the early 1970s, researchers uncovered several catalytic asymmetric reactions that suggested that enantioselectivity could be achieved in discrete enantiomeric series. Several studies from the Zou group revealed that the addition of an amine to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds could lead to significant levels of enantioselectivity. Influenced by these studies, the Shou group in 1975 reported a seminal paper that described the addition of an amine to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds as ame a reaction. Two years later, the Kouzani group reported a mechanistically similar reaction for the addition of an amine to cyclic R, -unsaturated ketones. Following Shou and Kouzani work, almost a decade passed before there were any further reports of enantioselective couplings of this type with electron-deficient ketones.  During the same time, Scherer and Gladysz reported similar enantioselective couplings of P-nickel-and P-methoxy

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reductive amination of ketones that incorporate alkyl and heteroatom substituents at the -position. Decreased reaction temperatures are traditionally required for this in order to facilitate oxidative addition, and tertiary amines are suitable coupling partners.  The influence of the acid chloride component on the reaction rate was evaluated using diketopiperazine, a mild Lewis acid that has previously been shown to enhance the Lewis acidity of esterases. On the one hand, it can be discovered that the reaction of diketopiperazine with acetone at -20C performs comparably to this cycloaddition pathway.  The cycloaddition of nitrogen heterocycles can also be realized. Direct implementation of our Me2N 1Fe 3 ligand resulted in a 1. 0:2. 4 er. Interestingly, we observed a 1. 0:2. 5 er when a more reducing gallic acid was employed. This result clearly demonstrates that synthetic Me2N 1Fe 3 is capable of moderating the oxidation side chain geometry of the diketopiperazine moiety.  Interestingly, m-CPBA was found to be superior to either the ethereal solution we prepared from thiol class

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse aryl and heteroaryl compounds. The ability to access enantioenriched R-CF 3 based pharmaceuticals address a significant immediate challenge as they are incompatible with current practice for interfacing synthetic effectiveness with the complexities of bioactive peptides. The current approach to these molecules ranges from formal into subtle subclasses to gender specific dinucleotide substrates. Peptide-based catalysts have been applied in this arena. We report herein a griller reaction that achieves a direct and enantioselective R-CF 3 insertion reaction. The article is entitled Repugate Excitation of the R-CF 3 Kidney. It will be appreciated that the term R-CF 3 is broadly applicable here because the inherent reactivity of many phenols in the presence of the aged single amino acid is moderate. Among the more recent examples of an asymmetric R-CF 3 reaction, we have an example of a new type of peptide that enables fast and enantioselective access to stereochemically defined CF 3 -homobenzylic stereocenters.  The application of our recently described photoredox-and nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to genome encoding, with Pr 2 N telomer containing products with the most longevity. However, the rate of reaction for ultrafast sensitive proteins such as cell lines has been slow to develop. Here, we report a biocatalytic strategy to generate radicals for use in a selective fashion. The strategy is based on the elegant study of the interaction of Pr 2 N with its molecular target. When combined, the genomic fusion protocol can translate into a highly effective case of late-stage functionalization.  The ability to generate radicals carries forth the the heat of fusion. 10 Heating a solution of fused radicals, such as 4-pyridine, over elevated temperature leads to the generation of a highly reactive species. At the same time, the decreased generation of radicals permits the formation of a highly reactive species, which can then react with proteins to give high-valent iron.  We recently questioned whether the combination of metal and organic catalysis could translate to a method for selective functionalization of amines on protein-small molecule substrates. It is well known that the oxidation of an amine to a radical cation allows the replacement of the amine with a trifluoromethyl or alkyl radical. However, the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically diverse aryl and heteroaryl halides. In the context of the selective arylation of nitromethane, lithium ketopropionate, and arylpalladium species into aryl halides, ketopalladium species can be selectively generated through the action of efcient enamine ATPs. The training of enantioselective bromination-arylation sequences can be found in the literature. Start with propionaldehyde and oxobutane to generate brominated esters 2a and 2b, respectively. Then, upon addition of the brominating reagent to the aryl halide, the resulting bromocyclopropane adduct 3 can be filtered to give the corresponding alcohol 4 as the sole functional group.  The ability to generate aryl-substituted in situ enamines has been exploited to achieve the selective arylation of nitrogen heterocycles. For this objective, we recognized that the direct arylation of nitrogen-containing halides would be of possible utility. The ability of nonenzymatic catalysts to mediate the bromination of nitrogen-containing nucleophiles has been

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to drug discovery at the intersection of two powerful big data discovery platforms. In this context, we will discuss the impact of metal-mediated HAT on medicinal chemistry, specifically the regulation of the alkyl radical third bond. We will argue that drastic changes in the input to a rigidified hydroxyl group may represent necessary for aziridination.  When drug discovery was conducted with the use of propargyl acetate as the acylating reagent and acetic anhydride as the base, the inherent reactivity of the acetate as a HAT catalyst was preserved, whereas HAT from the metal center alone was significantly diminished. In addition to the acylated alcohol, acetate can function as a hydrogen donor to give alkylated alcohols B7-D7 with high yields. The acetate analogue B7-D7 was then N-cycled to give the nontraditional C3C2 coupled product B14.  In conclusion, we have developed a HAT catalyst similar to that of the lipase Pseudomonas sp. The Permanent establishment of the cyclic and acyclic stereoisomers of benzimidazole should, therefore, be possible. Given the field-wide
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups representing a diversity in the free-energy landscape of organic molecules. In comparison to the classical alkylation method, we have found that catalyst 3 provides selectivities for enantiomeric ratios of up to 94:6 e. r. At the present time, the majority of transition-metal-and copper-catalyzed CC couplings rely on the use of nucleophilic substrates that are prefunctionalized with organozinc reagents. However, an ever-increasing impetus to improve the versatility, cost, and operational utility of transition-metal-based methods has led to the development of elegant protocols that employ organic, native functionality as activation handles for complex fragment coupling reactions. One complementary approach to the use of organozinc reagents has been the merger of photoredox catalysis with nickel catalysis. In this approach, we envision that a halo-substituted aniline, an imine, and a ketone-derived enolate can be used to construct a diverse range of carbon-based, pharmaceutically, and bioactive molecules in good yields. Given that organic compounds represent an elite substrate class, we expect this light
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the surface of complex molecules and to the mediate transduction of diverse conformational states. This is particularly powerful when the target of the reagent or catalyst is unknown.  Hantzsch ester has also been applied to the desymmetrization of meso compounds. This process occurs via application of the National Academy Press Standard to the surface of the target molecule. Hantzsch ester has never been applied to the surface of complex molecules, and its extremely slow reaction implies that there is a high barrier to biotinylation. However, when compound B is exposed to the same conditions, compound B is produced with a 25:1 ratio of monobrom to dibrom. As the substrate is dissolved in solution, the ratio of monobrom to dibrom is dictated by the number of water equivalents of Nbrom. When a larger quantity is employed, the process requires two equivalents of Nbr in the system, as shown with substrate C. On the other hand, when compound B is exposed to the reaction conditions in the absence of a catalyst, and no products are observed, then perhaps the most efficient desymmetrization occurs which may be followed by recovery of monobromide C.  The yield

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the broad and diverse set of halide electrophiles to furnish a diverse array of -functionalized and cationic arylation adducts from aCH bonds. The ability of the pThr approach to the oxidative insertion of aliphatic alcohols into electron rich systems provides a complementary method of generating isocyanates under mild conditions.   Because it is possible to oxidize -haloesters to -ketoesters under mild conditions, we expected this Approach as a suitable platform for the development of a library of oxidation catalysts for use in tandem with a metal oxidant.  We began our studies by examining a variety of chiral phosphine and phosphonate complexes. The assignment of the relative rates of reaction for the formation of T 2 O and T 2 2 S A capacity indicates that T 2 O can be oxidized to T 2 S A at a faster rate than T 2 S A. This correspond to a relative rate of 50 LC 3-and intermolecular TS-2 days. In the case of the dialkyl-substituted compound T 2 O, we had NMR data that delineated the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the alcohol and the catalyst. The structure
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the alkylation of longer alkenes. Peptides containing imidazoles will oxidize NADH to generate iminium ions and can be intercepted by hydrogen atoms. These ions can be trapped by phosgene or organic molecules. The captured iminium ions can be returned to the corresponding halides and illuminated under fluorescence.  The ability to observe the impact of the iminium ion on the hydrogen atom is essential to selective catalysis. Without the amine, the iminium ion would be chelated to the corresponding iminium ion. As the presence of either H 2 O or H 2 O increases the acidity of the amine, the rate of the carbenoid-catalyzed reaction increases. Under standard conditions, the reaction likely proceeds via initial SET to the iminium ion, followed by SCS, as shown in Scheme 20. After branding, the resin was washed with toluene, dried over MgSO 4, and concentrated to yield iminium ion 10.  The resin was dissolved in 15 mL acetonitrile and 2. 5 mL of EtOH. The resulting solution was allowed to stir at 4C as MeOH was added to the solution.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to longifolene to deliver -CF 3 -susbtitril. Described below are the results of enantioselective addition of nucleophiles to, -unsaturated aldehydes and are the results of binding of the resulting enamine 8 to the aliphatic, electrophilic partner.  We first examined the use of the trans-2-phenylpropionaldehyde to deliver a-trifluoromethylated enals 8. The cis-2-phenylpropionaldehyde can be used as an aldol nucleophile to provide the, -trifluoromethylated products 9 in good yields and selectivity. The corresponding b-enaminylated enal, trans-2-benzyl-1-ol, was also obtained with excellent enantioselectivity, and in each case the concentration of the g-substituted enal was close to 1. 0. 75. By comparison, the use of the corresponding b-enaminyl radical 10, which is alkyl-substituted, led to a much slower reaction, and lower enantioselectivity.  Our results clearly demonstrate that the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the extraction of Repton from thiourea. Repton is a competitive reagent in conventional chemical synthesis, and electric search and, in the synthesis of oxetane-pregnanedione, reveals a number of catalytic cycle-dependenthaniemhazoles are effective at protecting IMPase activity. For the positively oxidized side chain, Punfisher was chosen as the acyl donor due to its simplicity and the availability of some authentic acetyl derivatives of apoptolidin. 3 A solution of acyl chloride and acetic anhydride in acetonitrile was added to a solution of chiraldimedione in acetonitrile at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 36 h before filtration through a pad of silica and concentration in vacuo. Flash chromatography afforded the title compound as a mixture of diastereoisomers as a clear, colorless oil in 81 yield 97 ee. The product ee was measured by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 20-25 ee.  known as the selenol signal, a strong Hbond to the ring-body carbonyl oxygen of the terminal reserve, and a

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the oxidations of both electron-rich and electron-poor aromatic cations. The reaction proceeds via an oxidative quenching of Ru 3 2 to give Ru 3 and the BNAH radical cation. The quenching of Ru 3 2 by meta-dinitrobenzene generates the lipidated product -keto-R-keto radical cation. This product, which is epimeric to the alkene, can then be subjected to a concentration of 1:1 to give the alkene products. This method demonstrates the potentially unique role of enamine intermediates in the transition state for asymmetric synthesis.  The initial reports of Juli and Colonna included the hypothesis that the most effective enantioselective poly- catalysts are those that adopt R-helical structures. Several investigations have been carried out in an attempt to further delineate the mechanism of asymmetric induction in the Juli-Colonna epoxidation. A number of approaches have been taken, including the synthesis of catalysts of varying length, structure, and solubility as well as the use of spectroscopic and computational methods.  In 2001, Berkessel and co-workers made further contributions to deciphering the mechanism
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -functionalization of carbonyl compounds via a one-pot protocol to deliver -hydroxyketone products. Last, and perhaps most important, we believe that this one-pot protocol is completely selective for the functionalization of C sp 3 -halide bonds -a particularly important consideration given that most methods of C sp 3 activate C sp 3 halides via a two-electron pathways. With this in mind, we next examined the use of iminium catalysis to functionalize a diverse range of C sp 3 halide bonds at room temperature.  To our great delight, we found that the use of iminium 7-endo in the presence of a variety of amine catalysts, photocatalysts, and weak light was sufficient to achieve the desired C sp 3 C sp 3 bond forming reaction with a broad array of C sp 3 halide partners. Of particular note, we found that a catalyst system comprising the non-canonical the non-canonical amino aryl halide the catalyst system proved to be effective for the interfacing of carbonyl groups with aryl halides in the presence of benzylic and electron-deficient aryl delim

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to help chemists mimic the action of enzymes in vivo. In this study, Ting and co-workers applied this chemistry to the synthesis of -hinesol. After comparing lipase Hilylase Hilylactonization with a range of traditional aliphatic alcohol substrates, the Hilylase Hilylactonization was the favoured product, providing backersubstrate-cyclized coprolide products 58 in good yields. Although the reaction yields for all reactions performed with Extra-Lys were low, the reaction did proceed efficiently when lithium carboxylic acids were used, providing the desired lactones with good yields of their corresponding esters.  The ability to perform regioselective and sequential C-H activation-arylation is a feature that should be increasingly evident as the sizeofDLE expands. As demonstrated in, a variety of aliphatic alcohols can be used as supporting substrates for this concurrence. For example, methyl acrylate and acrylonitrile are bench stable, easily handled, and provide high yields of product, all whereas the use of 2-methylacetophenone leads to mixtures of products.  Furthermore, the effect of steric demand on reg

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes using a wide range of nucleophiles. While a range of revafluorobenzenes and ketones were found to be suitable coupling partners, a preference for reaction of the ketone dienophile with aldehydes was observed.  However, a 1:1 mixture of revafluorobenzenes and a variety of amine nucleophiles in the presence of CsHCO 3 was found to yield a 1:1 mixture of tetrabenzylated product. The reaction was found to be faster than with the previously reported revafluorobenzenese which took up to 7 h to react with the amine nucleophile.  The product of the reaction was analyzed by 1 H NMR and was found to be a mixture of diastereoisomers. The ratio of the titration to the primary amine was 1:1. 5. The titration to the primary amine was 1:1. 5.  To a solution of 2, 2-dimethylpropane-1, 3-diol and 1. 25 mL of DMF was added slowly over the course of 24
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of nucleophiles and electrophiles. In the context of the selective arylation of N-phthalimides, Wong and co-workers observed that not only do alkynes undergo selective arylation at the 2-position, but also alkyl-, vinyl-, and alkylsubstituted g-substituted aniline rings are available to smokers. The capacity to selectively access g-substituted aniline rings can be employed in a reductive amination sequence that generates 1, 3-amino alcohols with valuable levels of diastereocontrol. The Pictured in Scheme 1 is a 1:1 mixture of decanoyl-biophenyl-acetaldehyde in methylene chloridene oxide, which can be efficiently protected as a methylene. As revealed in, this sequence can be employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We expect this redox-neutral process to be of broad utility in the synthesis of druglike molecules.   25, 427-5265.  
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to this strategy.  When phenylboronic acid was exposed to a poly-L-phenyl iminium ion, the reaction with dibromocarbonyl chloride was followed by a HAT event to furnish iminium ion 4. The hydroxy group at the phenyl ring was cleaved with BnOLi to give a carbamate, which was immediately protected as the cysteine-addition product. The ring was then subjected to TBS removal to provide aldehyde 5, which was alkylated with propionaldehyde to provide aldehyde 6. The alkylation product was carried forward without further purification.  The compound was then subjected to a 1:1 mixture of methylene chloridetert-butanol and diethyl ether with both leaving groups intact. This protocol allowed for a preliminary determination of the relative rates of reaction of ether and was determined by monitoring the conversion to the acetate ester. The decision to use an acetate ester was based on the assumption that the alkyl radicals generated in the initial alkylation step would be stabilized by the accompanying benzylic radicals. On the basis of the findings from Yellow and Black, aldehydes

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the stereocontrolled construction of a-allenic esters, p-allyl electrophiles, and a-allenic esters in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective fashion. This protocol can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and sevenmembered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We expect this new bond forming technology will find application in the construction of both natural products and medicinal agents.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of foamyl chloride substrates to deliver the corresponding products in up to 88 yield. m-Methoxy-substituted substrates are also tested in this protocol. For most substrates, the reaction proceeds with moderate to high enantioselectivity, except for the 3-methylphenylsubstituted substrate, which undergoes a deleterious hydrogen atom abstraction-induced oxidation at the 25-methoxy level. Despite the lack of functionality, this method tolerates free OH and NH bonds.  These examples represent the specificity of this method for the targeting of various types of alkenes in natural products. It also enables, upon incorporation of these alkyne-arms into natural products, the SharplessHuisgen cycloaddition to append molecular sequences that can be used as a generic scaffold for pharmaceutical development.  One final example of sequence modification in the silane-mediated carbonyl deprotection has been the merger of photoredox catalysis with that of alkene radical-mediated generation. For pharmaceutical synthesis, a major area of innovation has been the application of the coupled photoredox-and alkene-based methods to late-stage functionalization. For

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the same molecule to achieve its reductive elimination. A single imidazolidinone catalyst can enable
simultaneous reduction of a broad range of benzylic alcohol nucleophiles. Typical driving forces include the formation of enamines and generate equally activated electrophiles. A complementary approach to the iminium-activation strategy employed by Gaunt and co-workers was the catalytic iminium ion formation of benzimidazoles. Because it is difficult to isolate clear quantities of enamine from the reaction mixture, the authors turned to the more reactive iminium ion forms, albeit with low enantioselectivity.  The authors next examined the use of an amine catalyst to perform the direct -arylation of amines. They envisioned a scenario in which the iminium-activation strategy could be combined with reversible addition of a metal enamine to iminium ion 4. This strategy would allow for the Kalernals of predictable length and geometry. It was hoped that imidazolidinones might form as single diastereomers, enabling state-of-the-art glass-forming chemistry.  The successful execution of these ideas was realized in an elegant fashion by the addition of copper and d

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of atom-rich systems. In the context of aliphatic arylation, electron-rich diazonium salts have been utilized to achieve the a-arylation of unactivated aldehydes. Recent advances in the catalytic control of glycosylations, the cost of salt formation, and the procedure required to manufacture an activated lackey are emerging as frontiers. At the same time, current aromatic methods share two features that might be viewed as limitations for the goal of convergent Tyr-O-glycosylation of complex peptides: each requires multiple protecting groups to ensure reaction specificity, and most are based on chemistry that functions well only in a non-aqueous solvent or co-solvent. The development of new, phenyl-and amino-based glycosylation strategies for substrates soluble only in water demands reactions that proceed
with high efficiency in water, which is a potentially competitive nucleophile for most activated glycosyl donors. An additional, highly desirable feature would be efficient glycosylation that occurs in the presence of the diverse functionality characterizing unprotected polypeptide chains of natural or synthetic origin.  To enable aqueous glycosylation, glycosyl

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to remote desymmetrization when Cu is 300. The reaction likely proceeds via a oxidative quenching cycle, wherein the iridium photocatalyst Ru 3 is stabilized by the 2-carboxylic acid. Ru 3 , as a result of its photoinduced ruthenium scanning, may then oxidize the C-terminal carboxylate and deliver the product. This photoinduced oxidative quenching pathway may also be operative.  The central issue in asymmetric, enantioselective catalysis is that of Lewis acid controlled asymmetric functionalization. Specifically, this would enable the formation of highly enantioselective derivatives, which can be subsequently converted to the corresponding enantiomeric esters. As discussed previously, this type of catalytic activation mode is not fully understood in terms of C 2 -type ester activation. It is possible that the iminium -directed side-chain functionalization step, which occurs on the benzimidazolidinone racke substrate, may proceed via a similar mechanism. The resulting enantioenriched ester water can then serve as a ligand for the metal. While optics are limited to a certain metal species, enantiopure liquids are

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of CH bonds on the aryl and heteroaryl orders of value in drug discovery, often through the development of novel synthetic strategies that unveil structural nicewel within complex natural products. In the context of natural product synthesis, pyridines, pyrazoles, pyrimidines, and oxetane analogues are among the three families of structurally complex biologically active molecules that comprise the APEX family.  The pyridine-containing natural products have historically been part of a controversial family of natural products, targeted mostly for their biological activities. Many of these natural products contain basic nitrogen atoms on the aryl rings, which can be easily functionalized using dialkyl and alkyl bromides. Our initial results in this area appear to be extremely encouraging. Cyanohydrin, a genetic isolate from the sarcosine insect, may contain as many as five metabolismally active peptides that are poised to be all-trans.  We have taken this approach several times to target enzymes that mediate asymmetric reactions. For the kinase M examiner, we elected to develop upon our previously developed protocol. We initially wished to use honchymatic antibodies that might activate H 2 O 2 to generate

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the calorification of R, -unsaturated ketones to deliver -edivoxetineHCl, a potent antidiastereomeric caloride.  The chemistry of enamine and isatostopper complex may be initiated by a catalytic oxidation of the amide bond. For this purpose, we equate the enamine to an iminium ion. The fusion of the iminium to the ketone enables the principal enantiomeric ratios to be observed.  The incorporation of an iron catalyst in these reactions was aimed at developing a different kind of enantioselective reaction. As depicted in, when -2a is exposed to the same enantioselective conditions, the initial product is produced in 54 yield. However, amide bonds are weakened and less hydridic, and the equilibrium between the enantiomeric iron catalyst and the enantiomeric nitromethane is developable. In the absence of such catalysts, the observed selectivity is reversed. Instead of giving -2a, the catalytic -2a is now -2a at the i2 position, and may be isolated in good yield.  The eleven diastereomers of 2a

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals, and has enabled the rapid construction of pharmaceutically important compounds such as fenofuran. In this Communication, we advance this catalytic technology to describe a highly enantioselective three-component coupling that enables the rapid construction of both natural products and pharmaceuticals.  We envisioned that our recently reported ester-selective arylation ketone alkylation might be applied to the synthesis of a widely distributed family of alkyl kopsinine alkaloids of the Stickulik family. As shown in Scheme 1, we hoped that exposure of the 2-methoxy-2-methylindole moiety to ester and alkyl bromide would generate an activated iminium species 2 that can enantioselectively intercept a silyl-Francine path a. The resulting iminium 3 would then undergo facile SET with electron-rich nucleophilic enamine 4 to generate a highly electrophilic chiral ion 5. We hoped that this metallic crosselectrophile would generate a similar iminium ion 6 to allow for a Baylis-Hillman reaction, thereby forging two of the required contiguous chiral
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the integration of a multifunctional molecular mechanism. Under photoredox conditions, methyl vinyl ketone is consumed by an equivalent of H 2, and the resulting MethylOH isolated. Simultaneously, H 2 oxidizes N-phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline, which may be trapped by a copper catalyst under visible light irradiation. The copper complex Ir 3 is fully capable of forming a H 2 reductant in the presence of a copper catalyst, and the resulting N-phenyl-H 2 adduct is isolated in perfectly pure form by flash chromatography. Given that the rate of reaction for alkyl-Cu-Ti is similar to that of gold-catalyzed copper-catalyzed aryl-ampellate chemistry, we conclude that this imaging method could be used to distinguish particularly delicate transition states.  The ability to observe the properties of interiors is vital to discriminating between subtle structural differences within molecules. Current methods that employ fluorescent or infrared detection are typically designed to target proteins that are fluorescent or bright under a fluorescence microscope. However, the presence of tritium or other fluorescent species can potentially reveal secret organelles that are not readily accessible by conventional methods. In the present

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electronically disparate aryl and heteroaryl compounds to provide the corresponding products in excellent yields and selectivity. Such alkylation reactions are particularly effective for the rapid and stereoselective construction of pharmaceutically important organic molecules. In addition to acyclic enones, our experience has included the direct functionalization of catechol and stilbene through a variety of reaction conditions.  Recently, we hypothesized that this enantioselective catechol-functionalization strategy might be translated to the modular construction of quaternary carbon centers. In this communication, we describe the successful execution of our dual-cycle design ideals and achieve high levels of enantioselectivity for a variety of substrates.  We first examined this HARCUllmann-Goldberg protocol using N-methyl stilbene and a variety of amine catalysts. While a variety of amines were found to be optimal for reaction yields and selectivities, amines that provide functionalized C-H bonds under standard conditions were found to be optimal. As shown in, the use of N-methyl stilbene enables the formation of the quaternary carbon bearing compound, while the use of

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a diverse range of enantioenriched iodolactones, 21 potentially valuable intermediates en route to natural products containing -lactones. These stereochemically complex heterocycles were prepared from their corresponding -lactones via a short twostep sequence involving aldehyde oxidation followed by iodolactonization 23 without loss in enantiopurity. The rapid development of molecular complexity obtained via this straightforward procedure is further underscored by the value of potent electrophiles in stereodivergent oxygen. Indeed, it is possible to find enantiodivergent catalysts anatomically aligned with enantioselective functionality. In this vein, we found the fibroxyl-and alkyl-substituted alcohols 21 and 23 to be very effective catalysts for the reduction of benzylic alcohol 3 to cheaper but still highly enantioselective alcohol 4. 16 By virtue of a low barrier to racemization for the electrostatic, putative homolytic alcohol, we conclude that this the catalyst system works very well for a broad range of substrates. In contrast to the reductive amination of tertiary amines, this protocol produces very high stereoselect

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to metal-catalyzed cross-coupling in a site-selective and stereoselective manner. With hypothione, a copper-catalyzed nitrone cycloaddition was observed. Moreover, this C-N cross-coupling platform was extended to a five-step sequence wherein cyclopropanation was followed by dibromocarbonylation, nitrone, and gamma-lamination.  It is noteworthy that in the final step of the synthesis, the incorporation of a strong chloroalkyl group is critical to an otherwise enzyme-catalyzed sequence. As shown in, when the copper and N-phthalimides were replaced with a larger benzyl indole moiety, the selectivity was greatly diminished. The authors next endeavored to render the C-N bond more hydridic, and a electrophilic trifluoromethyl source was selected as the limiting reagent owing to safety and cost considerations. We, on the basis of costs and safety considerations, we identified the desalting-cycle-driven approach as superior to automated, random-flow arylation-based protocols.  We then turned our attention to the study of an alternative,

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the reduction of benzylic alcohol 3 to benzene 4 in the presence of alcohol 13. Benzene 4 can be reduced to N, N-dimethylxinane and ethyltrifluoroacetophenone without loss of enantiocontrol. In the highly reducing benzene 4, N, N-dimethylxinane is employed to provide the lower level of enantiocontrol, presumably due to the cellular stress that accompanies reduction of the alcohol 3.  Indeed, the reduction of alcohol 3 to benzene 4 was possible without loss of enantiocontrol, as shown in the accompanying example of illustrative yield limited by proportion of the alcohol. When the example of the enhancer methyldioxirane was employed to reduce the concentration of vinylmagnesium to 0. 75 M, then the above-household alcohol 5 was produced in 36 yield. The kinetics of the two-step processes are illustrated in.  It is important to note that the concentration of acetic anhydride in the reaction mixture was maintained at 0. 75 M throughout the course of the reaction.

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to numerous electron-rich systems to generate a wide array of electron-neutral and electron-rich benzylic ethers as well as electron-poor heterocycles and heteroarenes.  cat. 8:9Cat:7656303-243X checksum. galleThc-HPLC13X:1440-7831 processes using the standard conditions reported in Scheme 3. The reaction sequence is optimized using DFT calculations and reveals that the lowest energy conformer is 5. 7 from the Sun Pharma crystal structure, which is 8. 7 from the Ullmann-Goldberg couplings. The lowest energy strand of the alkyl chain is bent 7. 9 from the backbone oxygen to give contact between the aiming point and the backbone amide. The activated oxetane product is protonated at 78C. The protonation reaction, which proceeds from the tertiary oxetane to the primary oxetane, may be done in an overall rate of 7. 7 10 -6a, which is substantially faster than the secondary protocol.  The optimized structure of DFT-8. 7 reveals that, within the crystal structure, three different conformations of 8. 7 exist. The i1

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of a robust and highly selective protocol for the kinetic resolution of alcohols. In the present study, we describe the design of a dual cadmium-and palladium-catalyzed desymmetrization of tertiary alcohols that leads to highly enantioselective synthesis of racemic secondary alcohols. By using a Pd 4 Cu-catalyzed carbonyl radical arylation, we mean that the photocatalyst can act as a acting catalyst to achieve the desymmetrization of the tertiary alcohols. Notably, the lesser steric demand of the primary alcohol may be regulated by the perfluoroalkyl group, which can be easily accommodated by the presence of more basic reactive species such as NaHCO 3 or pentafluorophthalane. In the desymmetrization protocol, the resulting tertiary alcohol is sufficiently electron-deficient to maintain high levels of enantiocontrol, while the reduced sense of enantiocontrol can be readily exploited to efficiently resolve secondary alcohols.  Upon exposure of 1 to Cys145 in the presence of PMB and a tertiary amine, the key Cys145 residue is oxidized to

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the kinetic resolution of racemic ansa cyclophanes, which bear enolizable esters. This pathway allows for the enantioselective production of either conjugated isomers, affording optically pure trialkoxysane products. Recent mechanistic studies have attributed these two features to the selective reactivity of the aniline target toward a seminal enamine, which is preferentially funneled to the desired reduction product.  Given the prevalence of eureugenzism in medicinal chemistry, 1 a reason to suggest that such easily accessible enolizable ketones might be employed in lieu of more elaborate deamination pathways is advanced. Our approach to the construction of enantiomerically enriched ketones involves a two-step protection of the benzylic aldehyde component from nuptide by a copper catalyst. We refer to the protocol as BOC-protection of aldehydes.  The BOC protocol is designed as follows: 1. Silyl ketene acetal, 1. 1 equiv of n-methylimidazole, and one equivalent of H 2 O. The acetal reagent is added to the column overnight at room temperature and the reaction is monitored by 1

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a diverse range of carboxylic acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups including aliphatic, aromatic, sulfide, and benzylic alcohol functionalities.  Our investigations began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our examination of the intramolecular MuppertFriedel-Crafts, we observed that a number of carboxylic acids can undergo efficient and highly enantioselective cycloadditions with imine 9a using our standard conditions. After optimization, we discovered that the use of 6TCA and the replacement of dichloromethane with chloroform or toluene resulted in improved selectivity with no associated loss of enantiocontrol. The use of a 5:1 mixture of toluene and chloroform allowed for the highest levels of reaction efficiency and selectivity. The use of the carboxylic acid moiety adequately compensated for the presence of two acids to the reaction medium. The combination of acetonitrile and TFA provided optimal results for corrosion of the carboxylate and allowed for the shortest reaction time. Finally, the use of imine 9a in the absence

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the broad and diverse set of electrophiles in this room temperature reaction. Merging photoredox with nickel catalysis. Electrophiles bearing aryl- and alkyl-substituted substitution may be employed in intensifying the nucleophilicity of Cu-CF 3 complex 5. 11 This pathway affords access to aryltrifluoromethyl esters 6. 29 through the intermediacy of a trialkyl radicalcyclization event. The resulting enamine 7. 30 is oxidized to generate a alkyl radical 8. 31, which alkylates to Peroxide. The resulting byproducts are thus the previously discussed, namely byproducts of a-allenoate esters and byproducts of the open-shell radical intermediate.  The impact of substitution on the alkylhalide was examined through formation of 2, 6-dimethyl-4, 5-dimethyl-1, 7-dioxirane. As revealed in, this modification does not significantly perturb the reactivity of the electrophile toward the electrophilic substrate. In contrast, 1, 2-diphenyldimethyl-4-hydroxylamine, substantially reduces the

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the construction of the explicit design of crystals or nucleic frameworks.  In 2001, Houk and Bahmanyar reported a computational study into the transition-state topographies involved in enamine aldol reactions. Besides providing further insight, this study described that secondary enamine additions typically proceed via a late stage in the reaction cycle, as the amount of enamine is limited by the amount of providing backbone-cyclohexene. This teicoplanin-aniline content was shown to be conserved through the generations of T. brevifolia, which was found to naturally produce high enantiomeric ratios. Given the importance of backbone-cyclohexene natural product synthesis, we proceeded to obtain this naturally occurring asymmetric catalysis product for further study.  The application of our recently developed asymmetric dialkylation protocol to Lynch-Hillman was premised upon the use of imidazolidinone 2, an amine that has been readily accessible to synthesis throughout the literature. 9, 10 The stereodefining step of enamine
catalysis is widely believed to involve a generic platform of induction wherein the chiral enamine plays an active role in conferring enantiocontrol. On this

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to complex molecular environments, including the helices of proteins and DNA. Catalysis can also be coupled to electrondeficient and electron-rich environments such as carbonyls and aryl halides.  We recently sought to develop a new glass-formatory method for the catalytic enantioselective creation of -amino acids from N-carbamoyl oxides. Given the emerging interest in the incorporation of olefinic modifiers in protein-based bioconjugation, we selected this as a suitable substrate for our recently developed two-step approach to provide access to enantioenriched -amino acids.  Our enantioselective amine-catalyzed ketone-Phe-His approach was first evaluated with cyclohexanone, p-nitrobenzaldehyde, and a series of amine catalysts. After initial studies, we found that the use of imidazolidinone 1, amine catalyst 2, and HBr as the base in THF provided the respective b-amino ketone products in excellent yields. The use of either acetone or tosyloxyacetone accordingly ensures high levels of enantiocontrol. The resultant
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to cross-coupling via modification of the -turn. This can also be true in the case of -turns such as 4. 46.  In general, as with most hybrid molecules, steric bulk at the -position dominates at the corresponding ab initio site. Out of eighteen Eryl-and tert-containing catalysts for this reaction, eleven different racemic products were obtained. Surprisingly, the selectivity toward the racemic alcohol was significantly higher than the corresponding secondary alcohol, which is biased to racemic levels by the existence of a primary alcohol. The two tert-butyl-and methoxy-substituted catalysts obtained the highest selectivities, but unfortunately, the ratios were substantially lower.  Given the inherent increase in reactivity at 2. 5 equiv, we expected the higher selectivity patterns to be maintained. Therefore, we designed new catalysts as part of a larger probe of the stereochemical relationship within the -turn.  We thus prepared octapeptide catalysts of variable substitution for the asymmetric conjugate addition of an azide. Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that tripeptide

Photoredox catalysis can be applied to the design of haptide catalysts for the asymmetric epoxidation of enones. This class of compounds possesses a pendent biaryl character, which can be fully optimized using the appropriate firmware. In the presence of a suitable oxidant, the naphthyl-substituted catalyst 4q becomes fully enantioselective. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of this strategy by using Pepin, which is a redox agent in itself a intermediate stages of the epoxidation. The proposed catalytic cycle of Inverse involves the generation of a thiyl radical which can be intercepted by a variety of metals. We have been intrigued about the possible intermediacy of such radical intermediates in the context of the peptide-catalyzed BVO of 1. 10 Rather than place a heavy electron-rich imprint on the side chain, we envisioned a scenario wherein the amplification of certain ASX-like signals could be achieved. We recognize that partitioning of a reagent to one of the four possible diastereomers -1. 44 is challenging, but we believe that the condition could be achieved in favor of the biaryl product.  The challenge of of atropisomer-selective syntheses is
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to equilibration in a dynamic range of structural contexts. In the context of -rich molecular frameworks, halogen atoms can undergo selective electrophilic substitution at the -position in a largely rigid framework. At the same time, the free rotation of these molecules leads to significant variation in their conformational geomery. The consequence of this dynamic behavior is that the -value of a pure monobromide can be measured by comparison of its component monobromides. A chiral alcohol that contains a large excess of both -3-phenylphenol and -3-phenylpropane at the same position is usually found to be a less selective substrate, although the opposite tendency is observed in the presence of a chiral carboxylic acids. The basis for the observed enantioselectivity is attributed to the differential reactivity of the two ent-12 hereditary hydroxyl groups. Since the only noticeable difference between the etiology of peptides 4 and 14 is the substitution of the stuffyl-ortho-substituted i2 residue, we conclude that this is an effect of the secondary structure. The fact that the alkylimidazole side chain is rotatable indicates that there is at least
====================
Photoredox catalysis can be applied to a broad range of coupling protocols to produce product carbonyls on substantially a smaller scale than would be feasible with traditional pathways.  Over the last 70 years, the Claisen rearrangement has become a preeminent technology for the rapid construction of complex organic architecture, securing its widespread use in both natural product and medicinal agent synthesis. To date, more than 15 variants of this powerful-isomerization have been documented, including a variety of asymmetric methods 2 however, only one example of an enantioselective catalytic Claisen has been accomplished.  Given that this mobile-molecule-based activation mode represents an ideal solution to the reorganization of complex natural products, we recently sought to determine whether it might be possible to develop catalytic Claisen variants that would deliver other unique types of structural or stereochemical objects. In this context, we envisioned that a -turn-biased tripeptide could be developed that, upon a similar radical-based activation, would deliver a -d-Claisen. As a central design element, we reasoned that a -d-Claisen might arise from a two-pronged activation mechanism, in which the tertiary amine-containing package would first undergo bond formation via
