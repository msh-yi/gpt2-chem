To design more selective catalysts, we targeted to synthesize as many as possible from the 225-35 yield of 1a to allow a preliminary assessment of the i2 and i3 chances. We think it is fair to say that we recovered 11 of our starting material, albeit with attenuated enantioselectivity in comparison to the results observed with the corresponding t-Bu group.  The work began by investigating the use of the diethylamino variant of the Tahtuelops catalyst 13. After explorations of the protocol with primary amide-and secondary amide-containing products, we observed that the use of the diethyl ethylidenemalonate Michael acceptor resulted in the formation of the industry standard, quinquin-deficient product 14a in a 22-27 yield with 94:6 er. The pan-acyl-substituted product 14b was converted to the BVP product 15a with 97:3 er and 70 yield. The result was a worldwide drop in both conversion and selectivity, but the reaction remained high.  We then turned our attention to the question of whether or not the BVP product 15a might be formed as a single diastereomer during mono-bead
====================
To design more selective catalysts, as well as to experimentally probe the mechanisms by which the catalysts are able to function. In order to do this, we turned to the combination of studies of site-selective catalysis and atroposelective catalysis. We chose to study the role of the site in the atroposelective bromination of quinazolinone 1. The origin of the observed enantioselectivity is believed to stem from the interaction between the 2-phenylpiperidine-1-ol moiety and the 4-phenylpiperidine-1-ol ring of the substrate, which allows us to conclude that the piperidine-substituted catalyst is able to bind the substrate via using a steric blocking effect. The phenyl group on the catalyst, facing the trans-face of the brinazolinone core, effectively prevents the release of this hindrance to enantioselectivity.  The initial observation of this study was quickly overshadowed by the fact that the 4-phenylpiperidine-1-ol was obtained in essentially enantiopure form. This result prompted us to initiate a screen of piperidine-and phenyl-substituted cataly
====================
To design more selective catalysts, it seems likely that both the primary and secondary amines of substrate A will be available.  Given the possible functionalization of nominal ketones, we sought to present compounds with as few restrictions as possible. We found that turbetobenzene. Our observations of Photocatalytic and Deoxygenated Substrate Ar leucine-Catalyzed Functionality and Structural Analysis a, b a Reaction conditions: substrate, diethyl malonate, Cu 4 BF 4, Cs 2 CO 3, DMFTol, or DMF. also seemed to apply to the case of the uncatalyzed bromination of ketones. However, the situation is markedly different in the presence of the non-functionalized catalyst.  For the case of the truly inhibited benzylic alcohol, we encountered a k rel 3. 0. Although we were pleased to find that bromination of the substrate under our previously developed conditions resulted in product mixtures, the rate of the reaction was poor, entry 5.  On the other hand, at this stage, we wondered whether the alcohol-containing peptide catalyst might develop a state of alcohol that was different from the state of the catalyst under conditions of optimized dilution
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we drew inspiration from natures catalysts. Enzymes have evolved to catalyze biochemical reactions with exceptional rate acceleration and selectivity by taking advantage of their well-defined folded structures to detect numerous noncovalent interactions, including those that are unexpected. We hypothesized that peptide-containing catalysts might also enable catalytic resolution of disordered molecules, if the heat of the reaction was slow enough. Hearn analogy to the story of macromolecular enzymes, in which sometimes the active site is gene-like, to allow for the formation of up to many secondary structures to interact with the substrates.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetterism. Our goal was to develop a catalyst that would reverse the inherent selectivity of this process from one of the two possible -ketone products to a single atropisomer. We chose to examine tetrapeptide 6. This peptide was biased to adopt a -hairpin conformation by taking advantage of its well-defined -turn secondary structure. The primary difference between the two alkyl-Ala-Gly catalysts, 6. 43 and 6. 44, was the degree of backbone bending. The pyrrolidine ring
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to develop a preliminary study of the effect of the peptide sequence on enantioselectivity. We projected that either a pentamer or a tetramer could serve as a well-defined, highly active script on the basis of our studies.  Our studies began by examining the effect of a-allyl-Ctf-FLAG, which we felt would favor a b-allyl peptide given its
well-defined as a Taz-bearing amino acid. Our choice of amino acids for both the i2 and i3 positions was based on our previous studies of Warby Parker and coworkers on the selective amino acid functionalization of carbamate esters. The i2 residue was planned to be a l-amino acid given its structural similarity to a well-defined -turn. The i3 residue was intended to nucleate several H-bonds to the acetamide carbonyl on the backbone, while the latter two residues were designed to harbor critical service information pertaining to catalysis.  We initially proposed a catalytic Warby Parker reaction between the cinnamaldehyde and the dyadetic acid. The stereodefining transition state should be possible in the presence of a suitable catalyst and a suitable supram
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we wished to determine the unobvious factors that govern the stereochemical outcome of the reactions. These factors are presented in a two-page supplement, entitled Supplement B.  In the initial reaction, we found that the use of 6TCA and the replacement of dichloromethane with chloroform or tosylene gave improvements to er such that 3G became the isolated product in 45 yield with 97:3 er and a big increase in tosylene alkylation ratio to 50:1. The use of benzyl chloride led to a small decrease in enantioselectivity to 64:36 er. We suspected that hodgkinsine was involved in a catalyst-substrate hodgkinsine H-bond. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that when 6TCA was employed, the reaction went out of control. The reaction did not return to the initial outcome, and improved selectivity was observed with more electron-rich tosylene substrates.  The results of the reaction indicate that a variety of steric effects may influence the results. Steric effects relevant to atropisomeric substituency were identified, including the effect of the steric size of the hod
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we next aimed to identify reaction environments that would allow for the selective incorporation of phenyl or heteroatom substituents on the aryl ring, thereby obviating the need for a N-protecting group. We thus examined the methyl vinyl ketone derivative as a template for selective arylation via alkylation with nitrostyrene. Our analysis was undertaken with the guiding principle that reactions would be conducted in H 2 O. In analogy to our findings in the addition of vinyl ketone to aliphatic ketones, we found that the use of MeOH as a base improved the overall efficiency for a range of cyclic ketones. Moreover, extended reactions were susceptible to the presence of electron-deficient aniline, methine, and quinoline-derived fertilizers. The introduction of an alcohol ingredient in the reaction mixture provided the respective product in moderate yield.  The results in yield and er suggest that alcohol is an important moiety in the reaction. Moreover, the column was found to be effective at preserving the enantiomeric ratio of the aryl ring in the second step of the synthesis, thus explaining the foibles of both aldehydes and ketones.  With an efficient
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we increasingly sought to identify reaction parameters that might reveal aspects of the catalyst that are specific to the substrate. In this context, we hypothesized that catalyst screening might lead to the identification of better peptides that might provide yield enhancements for the intramolecular reaction. In this context, we hoped that a nonobvious side chain might be identified at the end of the catalyst sequence. When the screening results indicated that peptide 6. 29 afforded k rel 30, we headed for the highly direct quinone aldol reaction. Our hypothesis was that this type of tertiary alcohol accelerator might allow for the screening of peptides for enantioselective reactions in the presence of other tertiary alcohols.  We began by screening a variety of tetrapeptides and tripeptides at the pentoselective b-carbonyl with high levels of enantioselectivity. To our delight, we found that the use of 2-phenyl-N-methyl-D-phenylalanine in the presence of a primary amine, Glucosyl bromide, and 2-phenyl-N-phenyl-dimethylaminopyridine greatly accelerated the reaction rates, whereas the use of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, this study was followed by a mechanistic investigation that stimulated hypotheses about a s-trans conformation for enantioselectivity.  The work began by collecting evidence for possible contact between catalyst 2. 24 and substrate. We were able to rule out alternative explanations such as anharmonic splitting within the same conformer, or even the presence of multiple isomeric forms with subtle variations in the carbonyl groups. To establish the definitive site of contact, we examined the catalyst structure. Within the confines of small sets of peptide catalysts sufficiently similar to the set shown in, we were able to find initial contact between the hydroxyl group at C-terminus of the peptide and the phenol-containing side chain of the substrate. It is possible that the steric they have been partitioned to a more geometrically favorable face of the aliphatic molecule, perhaps favoring an H-bond.  The incorporation of an H-bond in the side chain renders glycosyl ester more hydrophobic than the corresponding ester, and the side chain has a greater affinity for water. It is possible that the i2 amide also serves as a glycosyl H-bond, perhaps facilitating
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to develop a library of peptide catalysts biased toward behavior toward the type IIII type. Catalysts of this type are known to adopt -type turns often, although they tend to nucleate the expected type IIII turns depending on the Pro stereochemistry. Upon unfolding these structures in solution, the clear majority of the peptides observed, including the type IIII and type IIII, are once again observed to nucleate the anticipated type IIII turns. The presence of the type I " type II, type I, and type IIII in these structures offers the opportunity to observe them interact. However, the type I, type IIII, and type IIII are the primary structures of these peptides, and these are the primary functional groups within.  Based on these observations, we designed new catalysts to address the type I, type II, and type I, type I turns. The new catalysts were intended to capitalize on the demonstrated ability of these ThioAcK complexes to mediate H-bonding interactions between Hallnigs bases and electrophiles. 11 Given the publication of a new catalytic system in which the Pro and ThioAcK are effectively partitioned with high levels of enantioc
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in an iterative fashion, we would like to explore a numbers of different motifs of dendrimers we might enhance the stereoselectivity with each. Perhaps more obviously, we wished to make sure that all dendrimers that might afford aryl substitution turned out to be suitable substrates for the analogous epoxidation protocol.  As shown in, we found that the use of trans-2-nitropropanal was requisite to obtain the desired product with a high level of enantioselectivity. Of note, we also found that the use of 3-methoxy-2-nitropropanal led to the production of the product with a lower level of enantioselectivity, albeit with yields that are high in the project of converting epoxide 19 to the corresponding epoxide. The origin of the lower level of enantioselectivity is not fully understood at this time, although we have proposed that the -CH isomer is responsible for the lower level of asymmetric induction.  In summary, we have demonstrated that a short peptide containing a D-Pro residue undergoes a Steglich-type epoxidation reaction to give 2-nitro-aldehyde products.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we assessed 20 chiral phosphine and diene ligands with the phosphine-and diene-containing peptides as ligands. We were intrigued to find that phosphine-and diene-containing peptides 16a-d provided cyclopropanecarbonyl products with the highest er. Nine of the catalysts screened afforded product formation. Of particular note, peptide 16b, bearing a trans-2-Pmethoxy-L-Phe residue, provided cyclopropanecarbonylation products with the highest er.  The results of our initial study are shown in. As illustrated in Scheme 2, we envisioned that the 5-hydroxyl group of 1 might be targeted to produce a -turn that incorporates a central D-Pro-Xaa sequence. This would provide a Hi-L knitted ring structure that incorporated Acpc, Va, and the central H-D-Leu residue. As shown in, product 2 was isolated in 67 yield when protected as theacyl isomer with the addition of azide. The ion was purified by column chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 1 to 100 EtOAcHex, yielding a pure mixture of products.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, tweaked to small12. Catalyst 5. 23, which possesses an amide protected Dmaa residue at the i2 position, gave selective conversion to a 19:1 ratio of 1. 2:1. 0:18, with 1. 0:1. 0:14 site selectivity and a 92:8 ratio of 1. 2:1. 0:12. The increased selectivity of this reaction was attributed to the increased H-Bond donor ability of tertiary amides. On the other hand, peptide 5. 24, which lacks the i2 Dmaa residue, gave nearly racemic products.  Given the unprecedented nature of this type of catalytic targeting of complex molecules, we desired to understand the basis for the site selectivity. These experiments were in large part stimulated by the fact that the parent compound 5. 23 and its deoxygenated derivatives 5. 25 were not selective in this reaction.  Furthermore, we were intrigued by the fact that the more selective catalyst 5. 23, which lacks the i2 Dmaa residue, gave product 5. 26 as the major product in the mouse trap, albeit in the small amount of deoxygenated product 5. 27. A possible explanation for
====================
To design more selective catalysts, first by studying the reactivity of the i2 residue. We projected that any N-terminal bromide,. Complex, silyl, ethereal, or carbamate is suitable for this purpose. Simple unfunctionalized primary alkyl halides, low yields, and high selectivities were thus obtained.  The initial publication of this work focused on the selectivity between the first two and last two residues of the peptide. It was hoped that incorporating a tertiary amine moiety into the i2 residue would enhance the double bond between the i2 and i2 carbons. Indeed, the authors examined quite a few tetrapeptides that contained D, D-Phe at the i2 position. Unfortunately, very little of the diacetate 9 was converted to 10, with the trifluoroacetate 11 as the major product in the reaction. Furthermore, all attempts to form the product in the presence of a primary amine, primary amine, and aryl halides resulted in the production of secondary amine, primary amine, and aryl halides. In the end, the authors proposed a model in which the Cterminal Dha of peptide I called
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to better differentiate the reactivity of the 20-hydroxy group at the imine. We exploited the demonstrated ability of thioureas to activate electrophiles through H-bonding interactions, and we wanted to apply this powerful Friedel-Crafts strategy to the enantioselective conjugate addition of aldehydes into, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds. We postulated that the iminium ion might be generated via two SET reductions of the 2-pronged state, followed by protonation and oxygenation. We proposed that treatment of meat with methyl viologen dry enough to afford aldehyde and nitrostyrene would produce a, b-unsaturated ketone, which would then undergo a 6-exo cyclization onto a pending iminium ion. Similarly, we hoped that treatment of alkenyl ether with methyl viologen would lead to 2-epi-nucleophilic acid, which should rapidly undergo polynucleophilic substitution with amine 10 to afford 6-endo-trifluoromethyl cyclopentenyl ester 11.  Our enantioselective conjugate addition strategy was first evaluated
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we targeted to develop catalysts that would produce stereoselective products of all possible stereoisomers. In retrospect, we are surprised by the apparent lack of selectivity in the catalyzed bromination of quinazolinone 1 under the conditions we examined.  Since the apparent lack of reactivity in the second and third stereoisomers, we decided to examine other, more reactive flavinone catalysts.  The effect of water on the reactivity of quinazolinone 1 was next evaluated. The reaction between allenoate 1a and isobetrazole proceeded smoothly to deliver the desired product in the presence of bottled water. The reaction was studied without NaHCO 3 and gave no side products, which are known to be problematic for H-DAla-OH catalysts.  After the success of atropstable Suzuki coupling of Me-3a, we moved to try to optimize the reaction conditions. We found that a 1. 25:1 mixture of methylene chloridetert-butanol was a very competent catalyst for the atropstable bromination of simple alkenes. Using the same catalyst, we found that a 1. 0:1 mixture of methylene chlorid
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we knew we needed to develop a library of at least 50 Dmaa-type catalysts for testing. We chose to focus on peptides that both exhibited good atropostability and that could be biased toward bimolecular interactions. We chose 20 Dmaa-type catalysts we had prepared in our earlier studies. All peptides were in the family defined as type II by a central D-Pro-Phe-OMe, wherein the N-terminal Dmaa residue was functionalized at the i3 position through a helical poly chain. The catalysts were evaluated in the atroposelective bromination of quinazolinone 1. The results were promising with catalyst 4, which provided tribromide 2 in 86 yield and 93:7 er, against the racemic product 4. When the reaction was performed using peptide 5, in which the Dmaa residue was central to a branched L-Pro-Phe-D-Pro-OH moiety, the reaction remained sluggish and no product was observed.  We then turned our attention to the more atroposelective stage of the reaction. We envisioned that peptide-ligated transition metals could provide a
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we focused on peptides that could provide monomeric products. We chose 150 peptides of the same dimeric sequence as shown in Scheme 1.  We then evaluated 20 chiral phosphine and alkine nucleophiles versus a smattering of the C 2 -symmetric chiral phosphine propargyl whose CMC is greater than 150. We also evaluated 30 chiral phosphine and alkaline nucleophiles in the reaction of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde with propidium iodide. Peptide 6, with a CMC of 30. 1 mM, gave eluent-and product-monomeric products 7 and 8 in a combined yield of 87. 0:13. 0. On the other hand, peptide 9, with a CMC of 100. 0:15. 0, gave mainly the linear propargyl product 9 in its ppg-catalyzed reaction. The second product we observed was an alternativeet [ derived from the achiral phosphine 10, albeit in the absence of a small analogue.  The two factors that separate the two catalytic cycles are the (epimerization of the C 2 -OH to the corresponding C 2 -OH and the greater drain
====================
To design more selective catalysts, and the selective suppression of the formation of other byproduct, 4, 5-dideoxy-pyrazine, was achieved in each case by varying the amount of TEMPO. For the purposes of comparison we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Bis 1.c. The interest in enantioselective, enantioselective cross-coupling starts with typical follow-up steps. For example, initial coupling of the desired product 5 with the speed of typical CN coupling methods produces a product of reduced symmetry.  On the other hand, when the identical process is conducted with slow addition of TEMPO, a product of enantiomeric ratio is obtained. In this case, the measured enantioselectivity is very high, and the resulting byproducts are distant from the reactions central moieties. These results, while providing some evidence for the involvement of TEMPO in the desymmetrization of 1, raise the possibility that the peripheral aspartic acid side chain is crucial for catalysis.  The results of our current study are aligned with the proposal that one enantiomer is deposited in 50 mM and
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as many functional groups into the surface of the natural product as possible. As shown in, we found that a-oxy carbonyls were highly effective as arylating agents, providing the corresponding products in excellent yields.  The effect of substitution on the alkyl halide was next evaluated. From our earlier studies of bimetallic functionalization, we examined benzylic and heteroatom substituents on the aryl ring were found to be effective. We were pleased to find that the use of trans-2-phenylpropionic acid resulted in measurable yield.  Next, we set out to investigate the effect of the aryl ring structure on reactivity. We were pleased to find that a variety of substituents on the aryl ring were effective in the desymmetrization. For example, electron-deficient aryl chloride stripped from the mother liquor to give the corresponding dibenzylated product in 88 yield, albeit with lower reactivity than observed with the corresponding silyl chloride. The addition of electron-rich lithium to the lamine catalyst 11 had no effect. On the other hand, the use of the mixed Kessler Modification 21 with

To design more selective catalysts, they studied a unique, peptide-based catalyst for ab initio-and diastereoselective aldol reaction.  Experiments. Peptide-Based Catalysts for Aldol Reaction in the presence of Acetic anhydride. Peptide-based catalysts are batteries that have been primed with basic nematic reagents and electrophiles. They are based on the simple modification of a particular peptide sequence, in which the proline residue is converted into an L-Pro. These catalysts were applied to the reaction of acetone with hydroxyacetone in toluene at ambient temperature. The results are reported as kinetic resolutions. The results of the reactions are most consistent when evaluating the effect of the reactive species. Example, b enantiomeric ratios range from a poor 52. 5 : 47. 5 to a moderate 72. 5 : 27. 5, indicating that the combination of L-Pro and the peptide provides a catalyst that is substantially more active than the separate catalysts. On the other hand, when comparing 2. 5 : 1-trans-1. 30, we observed a significant increase in selectivity to 75 ee, which we attribute to the ability of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we now focus on the need to Control the stereochemical fate of the catalyst. Specifically, we wondered whether the 4-enaminyl-4-palmitoyl group might be a suitable directing group. Among the previous catalysts we had designed, the enantioselectivity was significantly improved when the achiral centerpiece was replaced with a palmitoyl group, and the reaction was allowed to stir for 15 min. A small amount of tert-butyl-and acetyl-bearing product was produced, but the ratio of the major and minor isomer was changed. In this case, the more-bead resulted in the minor aldol product, that is, the more recrystallized 4-enaminyl-4-palmitoyl was found to be the major, in a ratio of 1:4. Importantly, change in the olefin substituent did not significantly perturb the enantioselectivity.  The effect of the crystal structure on the recrystallization rate was next evaluated. Remarkably, we found that the reaction was complete in 6 hours, even after recrystallization. This long time frame convinced us to use the recrystallization method
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the libraries.  Our initial target, 3-deoxydioctanal, was analyzed using a enantiomerically enriched set of catalysts derived from our earlier studies of stereoselective epoxidation. While we were initially concerned that the presence of a state of haste in the reaction mixture might diminish the inherent selectivity of the epoxidation, we found that the addition of approximately equal quantities of the deoxydioxy-and alkenyl-substituted imine 5 and thixine 6 to a solution of 8 and pivalamyl iodide in DMF at room temperature readily effected soft enolization, allowing the corresponding epoxide 7 to be formed in 28 yield. Similarly, the use of THF with the addition of 8 was found to be beneficial for asymmetric induction, as demonstrated by the production of epoxide 8 in 91 yield.  Inspection of the X-ray crystal structure of 8 reveals that there appears to be a -turn consisting of a central iten. This observation is consistent with our prior observations. As revealed in, there are three proteinligand hydrogen bonds between the pivalamide nitrogen and Glu166 nitrogen, Nitrile,
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we aimed to develop catalysts that would confer selective contact with the inner core, as well as with the loop-regions of the catalyst. We were mindful that the filtrate a concentration greater than 50 mM was required to achieve 70 ee, which we felt would be sufficiently high to avoid protonation of the minor ceramide.  We postulated that contact between the catalyst and the C-terminal functional group would be necessary to achieve high levels of enantioselectivity. We were mindful that the loss of homodimerization could lead to substantial differences in krel for reactions performed on racemates vs those conducted on single enantiomers. We were pleased to find that the use of vivocyanoimides improved the enantioselectivity whereas ketones provided superior selectivities.  We next focused upon linking the l antipode of the callipeltose C-terminal functional group to the macrocyclic core 18. Using again, we were mindful that the ester group of callipeltose C-terminalizes the same functional group, and we chose to retain the enantiopurity of the callipeltose C-terminal region. Using again, we found that
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we targeted to develop catalysts that would produce unique atropisomers selectively. We chose to develop the first-order analysis of the HPLC traces of the reactions, assessing relative peak areas without a rigorous determination of response factors for individual components of a given reaction. Even with these approximations, we were able to observe immediately that the impact of the catalyst-arene 2-fold greater than the isolated H 2 oxidation product.  In order to clearly distinguish the components of the catalyst from each other and to test the validity of our second-order analysis, we elected to further explore the site of oxidation. We chose to examine the reaction of –3-phenylpropionaldehyde and acetic anhydride in the presence of MgBr 2 OEt 2, a catalyst that has previously been shown to selectively form the C3-hydroxy-inositol 3 product when used in the absence of a co-catalyst. The presence of the benzylic carbamate to produce D-3-deoxy-3-phenylpropionaldehyde was unexpected, as the two reactions in our prior studies had involved the co-catalyst of acetic anhydride with a strikingly different catalyst structure. In

To design more selective catalysts, and electrophiles. In this regard, our studies were particularly inspired by the possibility that our recently described enantioselective a-allylation of ketones could be translated to sites of further refinement.  Our initial observations on the conversion of elaborated a-allylation protocol to enantioselective a-allylation catalysts are described in. Initially, we were pleased to find that a diverse array of ketone dienophiles underwent conversion to the corresponding a-allylation adducts with useful levels of enantiocontrol. However, our initial observations on the conversion of elaborated a-allylation to ketone dienophiles led us to interrogate them on the issue of enantioselectivity. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized the m-CPBA catalyst 15, in which the mode of a-allylation was tested as described in Scheme 1. In this case, we observed that ee could be achieved in the absence of a catalyst, suggesting that the reaction could be zero order in the dienophile.  We then turned our attention to the issue of enantioselectivity. We describe here our initial efforts in the area of site-selective a-allylation of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, this study was followed by a mechanochemical study which demonstrated that the selective formation of cis product could be achieved through addition of Zn to the reagent containing a free N, N-dimethylphosphinamide.  The mechanistic study discussed above describes a selective Ely waiting list, which is quite remarkable for a process which is essentially an equilibrium between competitive independent pathways. The list of selectivities, which constitutes the current yield of asymmetric synthesis, is obtained by calibrated dilutions of the bitumen, which is used in the next step. The known cilalytic preparation of up to 75 yield could be used for this purpose. In this way, naturally occurring trans- arenes are preserved, and the process is allowed to proceed.  The selectivity of peptide-based catalysts now differs from the days of Lys-DAla-DPmh. After a catalytic cycle, when the free amino acid is cleaved from the peptide, the resulting C-L bond is cleaved and the resulting C-D bond is formed. The current cilalytic ratios are 100:1 d. r. and 200:1 d. r. for and, respectively. The rates of the sequential addition of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, such as those based on bimodal tetrapeptide that contain a key dimethylaminoalanine residue at the i2 position, we attempted to incorporate both aspartyl and m-CPBA, as well as to incorporate other amino acids that might undergo aqueous workup. We also examined the reaction of m-CPBA under unsymmetrical lane-current conditions. Despite the fact that the m-CPBA-favored product B was derived from a BINOL-derived enolate, the yield of product B was inflated to 91:9 B.  Reaction of m-CPBA with sugar and m-CPBA. The reaction of m-CPBA with sugar and m-CPBA was studied at 25C. The substrate and m-CPBA were added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was agitated at room temperature for 1 h. After adding more paint to the reaction mixture, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the resulting residue was analyzed by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography.  After an extensive survey of peptide-based catalysts, we finally arrived at catalysts that exhibited a noticeable increase in selectivity.  We initially wished to investigate the role
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the authors focused on peptides that had been optimized previously. After screening 135 peptides of the library, peptide 42 was revealed to possess a chromatographic-to-electron imbalance in the i2 position, resulting in tetrapeptide 43 as the producer. The identity of this product was established by 1 H NMR, as phosphorylation of the tertiary amine product would generate a type II C2P product upon the addition of acetic anhydride to the phenol structure. In order to validate the structure of 43, and perhaps to enhance the production of 50, she produced a variant of the Ali P functioning as the N-terminal methylene. This precursor was found to adopt a -turn format, where two different side chains were accessible to the Pmh-side chain. The GC assay that separates both 5 and 23 could be performed with some confidence. The order of magnitude decreases in the range of 150-165, with a minimum of 35 ee. 
With the high enantioselectivity in hand, the authors sought to grow the class of asymmetric catalysis. This approach is founded upon the use of the concept of collective catalysis, wherein various chiral catalysts
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined 65 substrates that are capable of adopting -turns. As highlighted in, we observed that catalysts derived from most of the. The screen was performed without further purification.  Analysis of the Sugar Derivative. The reaction of phenyl 4, 4-bis-isopropylsilyl-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate in the presence of benzoyl chloride, 1, 1-carbocyclopropane, and a series of chiral secondary amineHClO 4 -ATF all-methoxybenzyl bromides were reported to be catalyzed by 40-50 ee. The catalysts reported that bromide-coupling reactions were possible. However, under otherwise identical reaction conditions, we observed a dramatic decrease in enantioselectivity.  Our results, in combination with a vast array of data found in the literature, provide a number of insights into the design of organocatalysts for different substrate classes. The mechanistic aspects of the catalysts are intriguing. As noted, the data seem to imply that selective bromination substrates induce a conformational change, analogous to the effect
====================
To design more selective catalysts, a library of 60 tetrapeptide catalysts that are capable of adoptting enantioselective has been synthesized in order to identify the best fit for the substrate. The catalysts have been prepared in a variety of solvents, with toluene providing optimal selectivity, which is then compared to the product distribution determined by UPLC. The catalysts are matured in a dialkyl solution, which allows for an international comparison to the tangible scale. As revealed in, the number of catalysts that have been prepared in order to identify catalysts that also yield significant results is comparable to the number that have been isolated by natural expansion. It is important to note that the sense of enantioselectivity is rather sensitive to the size of the catalyst. For example, give a ladyba near 1 N, and she will give a k rel 50. Or, take a chiral phosphine and add a hydrogen atom to her will result in a k rel of 49. The example of a catalyst that exhibits a range of selectivities is 2-chloroperbenzoic acid, which bears an interesting k rel of 41. The fact that a large majority of the catalysts are composed of unique amino acids is promising.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, there continues to be a need to discriminate between numerous similar structural motifs in order to achieve high levels of enantioselectivity. The need to discriminate between similar structural motifs is particularly significant given the presence of many similar hydroxyl groups at the C-terminus of these peptides. Given the preference for the lactone derived from quinazolinone 1, we considered the possibility that an enantioselective bromination might be possible. However, the presence of a pendant tertiary amine base proved to be critical for enantioselectivity. Thus, peptide 4, bearing a control peptide-ligand sequence, was found to be a highly selective catalyst, delivering tribromide 29a in 86 yield and 97:3 er. Slow addition of NBS was crucial to achieving this level of selectivity, as it possibly allows more complete reracemization of 28a and thereby enables a more efficient DKR. Under these conditions, 30 h is required for the reaction to reach completion.  With optimal conditions in hand, we next examined the structural diversity of the aryl halide coupling partner. Notably, sterically demanding -branched substrates were found to be competent in

To design more selective catalysts, he and co-workers sought to identify a library of longer peptides that might adopt as wide range of conformations, including some that were skewed toward secondary structures. ( Given the trend of increasing complexity in catalytic circles, and the need to generate diverse Picens, Cys145-like scaffolds, the Edstrom group began to study short peptides of known sequences, including those that were biased toward -turns.  The group was initially concerned that the truncated, Ther-containing peptide 2. 23 might favor the formation of a H-bond between Pro and the remaining Boc-Pmh, preventing formation of a nasty S N 2 by offsetting the backbone H-bond. This H-bond, or lack thereof, was dependent on the identity of the C-terminal residue. While all of the tetrapeptides that were screened afford some selectivity, the results were dominant for the type IIII -turn. Furthermore, the narrow range of values that were measured bothered us, as we tried to optimize the catalyst structure without a considerable amount of symmetry-independent conformers.  Since the catalyst was designed to adopt type IIII -turns, we instructed him to place a p
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to improve the reaction outcome. We hypothesized that if the site-selectivity observed in the k rel contested a catalytic residue, which is likely to be the most biologically literate region of the molecule, was to be translated to more complex polyunsaturated compounds, the existing problems in selectivity would be resolved.  We proposed that if the 1, 3- relationship between 8 and 9could be translated to a 0. 6:1 ratio of monoacylated to monoacylated products, with the current ratio of 1:4. Reverse phase HPLC analysis of our GPR-40 amplified the signal and ratio showed that the signal, ratio, and diacylated products are all significantly greater than the sum of the two tones. We speculate that the deactivation of AMP and Phe 2 by protonating the phenol peak for the silane reduces the dibenzyl proton and gives rise to a -amino radical 10. The resulting -amino radical 9 is oxidized by the Ir IV species to produce iminium ion 10, which is hydrolyzed to deliver 11. The Ir IV species 9 can then be resurfaced by one of the two reaction pathways MacMillan-Mill
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we focused upon the use of peptides with natural product functionality as a biased selection technique. Our initial catalyst library consisted of 14 Dmaa-containing peptides biased toward type IIII -turn structures. Within our initial screening regimen, we struck upon the significant addition of a tripeptide to the reaction mixture of 3-acetoxyquinuclidine and methyl 3-etertiaryhyl ketone. As shown in, the presence of a Dmaa residue within the peptide sequence provided a noticeable increase in the er. The 3-acetoxy derivative was likewise found to be a more selective catalyst, providing 7 in up to 93 yield with an er of 88. 5:11. 5. The use of the hydroxy-substituted quinzinylalanine resulted in a significant decrease in selectivity, providing 7 in 86 yield with an er of 10:1. 5. The effect of the olefin geometry on the enantioselective catalysis is demonstrated in the transition state. Phe-containing peptide 10 disposes the plane of the catalyst and the face of the aryl ring in close proximity to each other, resulting in a near doubling of selectivity. On the other
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we crossed the
same evolutionary arc as design of the resonances for 6 and 7. In the case of 9, the APPRECY experiment, which employs a single amino acid, furnishes its corresponding product in 25 ee. In contrast, the use of D-Pro in peptide 10 provides up to 38 ee, including significant rates of enzymatic metabolism. The same site selectivity is observed for the formation of 10 in the presence of multiple amino acids. The sequence-dependent nature of the results, as well
as the observation of multiple catalysts with subtle variations in selectivity, have led to differentiation among the different classes of catalysts.  The immediate and highly functionalized structural features of these peptides are supported by NMR studies of the Protronspot Mixture. Analysis of the solution phase TEMPO ion indicated a conformational equilibrium between 1 and 5. The same equilibrium was observed previously with this substrate. On the other hand, the solution phase composition of peptides provides some evidence that the conformational equilibrium between 1 and 5 is inhibited by the presence of HCl. The simulation results of peptide 3 alone in chloroform can be supported by two intermolecular NOE correlations. First,
====================
To design more selective catalysts, current alpha-phase reactivity products were prepared in limited quantities. To access these compounds via long-standing chromatography, a method was developed using 7-endo-dig cyclized urea 6 as the alkylating reagent. Under optimized conditions, 6-endo-dig cyclized to generate all three diastereomers of 6-endo-dig cyclized.    Current effort: None.   This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 activation reaction to the catalyst. Unproductive consumption of H 2 O 2, oen accompanied by the generation of highly reactive radicals, is very commonly observed when modest changes are made in the rst coordination sphere of the effective catalysts. The introduction of structural diversity in the second coordination sphere may represent a valuable alternative. In this regard, strategies that implement versatility between the thoroughest groups of the i2 residue, his side chain, and other parts of the peptide have been successful in the past. With these approaches, we anticipate that the l, 5-tris-phosphine-and Pentapeptide (and if all 3 were to react under the same reaction conditions, we would obtain the biaryl product.  To evaluate the possible reaction mechanisms we began
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a library of 15 Asp-containing peptides biased toward types IIII by incorporation of either L-Pro or D-Pro at the i and i4 positions. We synthesized a library of 18 Asp-containing peptides of the type IIII class, and a similar library of 15 monomeric and 49 Asp-containing peptides was synthesized to determine the personal characteristics of the peptides. The results of the studies are presented inandin the Supporting Information.  Support Information is available in the online version of the paper.  Author Contributions R. T. S. and X. Z. contributed equally.  In contrast to aspartyl peracids, peracids of the type IIII class have been observed to nucleate additional specific carbenoid species such as dihydrobenzins or dihydrobenzins, and to treat human cancers 22 via deregulation of S-cell DNA synthesis. The concept of the specific incorporation of a carbamate into a complex peptide is a conceptually attractive procedure owing to the potential to store and transmit carbenoid information through the medium of the carbamate. The issue of methanolysis as a potential pitfall in such catalytic
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we assessed 20 chiral phosphine and phosphonate substrates with both the pThrtype and C 2 -type of CPA. The utilization of everyone except DCM, which has a very poor NI relationship, resulted in severe depletion of both yield and selectivity. Additionally, the reaction with 2-penten-1-ol afforded a low yield of the product, which was nearly racemic. The low yields of the reaction with 2-penten-1-ol could be attributed to the unfavorable steric interaction between the naphthyl group on the substrate and the 3, 3-dimethylpiperazine systems, which worsens the interaction between the catalyst and the substrate.  Since the low enantioselectivities observed in the phosphine-and phosphonate-based conversions of a-allenic esters to enones, we suspected that low enantiocontrol could also be achieved through selective catalysis. Accordingly, we prepared octapeptide catalysts of each enantiomeric ratio, and they were prepared in enantiopure form. When the reaction was performed with DCM as the solvent, the resulting p- butyl ester underwent cyclization at stabilizing concentrations to
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we envisioned a series of control experiments that would determine the inherent reactivity of a given substrate toward a given secondary alcohol. reExamine a given secondary alcohol toward a preloaded urea, such as 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, and observe the difference in the reactivity. Of course, we were keenly aware of the possibility of overfunctionalization to give bis 24. In fact, we were delighted to find that a derivative of our initial mimeuride, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, gave exclusively the Tietze product 25 in our possession.  The initial reaction of alkyl nitrobenzaldehyde in our laboratory employed ethyl vinyl ketone as the alkylating reagent. As shown in, we were delighted to find that a broad array of electron-deficient alkenes readily participate in this new double-catalysis protocol. For example, quinoline, phenyl-substituted quinoline, and benzyl-substituted quinoline are readily tolerated. Moreover, the implementation of the sterically demanding methyl substituent allows raw access to the notorious compound V, whose structure has found application in medicinal chemistry.  The sense of asymmetric induction
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a pThr-based catalyst with the appended sequence of peptide 6, previously utilized in the BVO of 3-amidocyclohexanones, an analogous catalyst to the authors solution structure. As such, peptide 7, with the pThr residue at the i3 position, was prepared. Under the same conditions, peptide 4, with the C-terminal region replaced with a methyl substituent, was much more selective at the corresponding position, delivering 5 in 91:9 er. Notably, the MCPHA catalyst in the presence of a quinone-isite was identied to be less selective than the analogous quinone-e, in accord with the greater steric demand of the methyl moiety.  In analogy to the results observed by the alanine scan approach, we cylinder scanned the peptides in the presence of imidazolidinone catalyst 7 and an achiral counterpart, 8a, which exhibited a greater-than-statistical preference for the 6, 7-ratioisomer. In stark contrast to catalyst 6, which exhibits an excellent 1:5 ratio in the presence of nucleophilic imidazolidinone, the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turn our attention to the applications of the discovered library of 12 as a library for the screening of libraries of future libraries.  Oxidative nitromination of alkenes is an area of intense interest, as a variety of methods have been developed for the modification of this function have included both enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysts. As such, it is a likely that the next generation catalysts will be suited to this more complex situation, as n-factors in the vicinity of the catalytic moiety can often enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of the Chiraldic acids. In the case of the enzymatic catalysts, an analogous strategy has been achieved through the use of a Pac-Lem-Lad" a molecular machine made of the proline. For the nonenzymatic catalysts, a collaborative library of co-catalysts has been discovered to date that differs from the ramped catalysts in only one arm, as the peptide-based catalysts have been found to be effective for asymmetric conjugate addition reactions. The terminal
amine of the dipeptide contains a catalytically generated iminium ion that can be quenched by an excess
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we hypothesized that class 3 Ta steric mimics of histidine should be available. In this vein, we were particularly attracted to give the reverse effect of histidine.  Our initial empirical examination of the library showed that peptide 6. 28, which possesses the Fast -Trp-AcK residue at the i2 position, gave the best enantioselectivity in the chamber. This ratio decreased significantly when Substituted with ammonium chloride, and when the reaction was conducted at room temperature. Nevertheless, upon evaluation of the acetone aldol product in the absence of any qualifications, the enantioselectivity improved modestly. It is noteworthy that 5-fold reduction in enantioselectivity was observed when achiral base was used. The results of the enantioselective aldol reaction using reaction members of the Tapillus species were obtained at lukemic temperatures. A screen of 70 different enantiomers of tapillus mineral water revealed that the stereoisomer obtained with the highest ee value was the rediscovered enantiomer.  In order to establish the absolute configuration of the slow reacting enantiomer, we measured the optical rotational barriers of the two enantiomers as a
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to evaluate the effect of the recrystallization on the er of the product. We knew that S E Y N O was functionally equivalent to the SRP equivalent, so we re-examined the reaction, focusing on 10. The reaction now produces the product, with lower er 6:5 ratio.  We then decided to examine other substituents on the aryl ring. We initially decided to decrease the amount of Cu to 4. 5 equiv, but the product was obtained in 26 yield of the product, relative to the 4. 0:1. 0 er of the S E Y N O. We then umpolung the reaction temperature, as might be expected, to afford a higher yield of the product. We also noticed that the reaction was quite sensitive to the steric effects, as the membered ring H-D closer to the alkyl group than the unprotected S-H group.  We then decided to investigate the effect of the alkyl group on the reaction selectivity. We knew that substituents approaching the limits of the structure gave lower yields, perhaps by preventing the formation of oxetane in the first place, thus perhaps by preventing deleterious reductive
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to better differentiate the reactivity among the different isomers of the cation intermediate. We thus targeted a method to produce an intermediate monomer, which could be elaborated to provide a variety of different isomers of the cation intermediate.  Our initial attempt to achieve differentiation among the isomers of the cation intermediate led to us launching a study of Middle East proline as a catalyst. The cation intermediate we sought to produce is derived from imidazolidinone 28, which undergoes addition to the dibenzyl ester at the 2-position. The resulting enolate 29, which is monomeric as well as electrondeficient, was isolated in good yield. We then turned our attention to the more sterically hindered tertiary alcohol 30. In this case, we hoped to find a chiral source of chirality to facilitate the screening of our product in the presence of the secondary alcohol. However, we were saddled with the fact that the tetrahydro-piperidinyl type of alcohol 29 was autocatalytically generated after the first recrystallization. As such, we attempted to source as little as 5 ee to 30 in a single recrystall
====================
To design more selective catalysts, our attention turned to the macromolecular level. As shown in, a variety of chiral phosphines were coupled with 4 cystine, phenylthionochloroform, and naphthyl -substituted imines to afford products that were functionalized with enantiomerically enriched, drug-like ester monoesters.  Our results, in combination with a vast array of data found in the literature, provide a number of insights into the design of catalysts for different family of conjugate addition reactions. In particular, the treatment of enone with an excess of chalcone-like catalyst would afford a prochiral imitation of the chiral insulin. On the other hand, so-called blue suicide primed chemicals, which bear a pendent diazonium group, are very much more reactive than the piloted vaccination strategy.  In recent years, our lab has become interested in the phenomenon of P-sets in biotin-governing peptides. This class of compounds, which bear a diazonium group at the N-terminus, has proven to be effective for a variety of bioconjugation reactions. For example, treatment of chicken serum with 5-
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the goal became to identify the most selective among the previously known co-catalysts of the MBH reaction. A number of approaches were taken, including the screening of libraries of resin-bound compounds and the collecting of from long-standing libraries of catalysts. Upon screening 305 catalysts in the MBH reaction between 4-methoxybenzaldehyde and acetone, two new catalysts were identified: PEasyl and PEPsyl.  The two new catalysts were immediately ided and compared to a strategy of screening catalysts from a diversity library. Upon assignment of the relative stereochemistry of the two new catalysts, diversification of the library was observed.
A third library was immediately prepared to take positions A1, A2, and A3. The new catalysts were immediately prepared, and their structures were determined by consensus.  Upon completion of the second reaction, 500 radically pure daptomycin was taken from the cassette and diluted in 200-folded brine. The bulk of the solution was imaged with 200-folded glassware. The sample was sealed in a standard 10 mm round-bottom flask, and the colourless solution was distributed in 1 mL aliquots to reaction vessels
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a library of 15 Asp-containing peptides biased toward type II -turns. Peptide 5, which possesses an Asp residue at the i2 position, was found to be a highly selective catalyst, delivering tribromide 29a in 86 yield and 97:3 er. Slow addition of NBS was crucial to achieving this level of selectivity, as it possibly allows more complete reracemization of 28a and thereby enables a more efficient DKR. Under these conditions, 30 addressed a broad scope of quinazolinones. Notable exceptions include 2-CF 3 -containing 28b, which is nearly C 3 quinazolinoney and substantially more selective than the corresponding cubical type IIII variant 28a. While the aforementioned benzamides are both less selective than 28a and 28a, the 7-styrene-containing 28c was able to address a reasonable scope of quinazolinones 1-5 via IntelCenter. 29. The alkyl-substituted acrylate 30 was similarly general in purpose, delivering tribromide 29d in 87 yield and 75:25 er. We have observed that even the more electron-rich -substit
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a library of as yet unknown to be selective, enantioselective oxidation catalysts. We chose to develop the screens around the use of catalyst 6, which itself is representative of a well-functioned enamine, with its C2-symmetric backbone. Peptide 6, with its primary amine, yields products with up to 92 ee. When the reaction is conducted with catalyst 4 at 25C, with a carefully prescribed amount of N-bromosuccinimide, the results are similar. The phosphopeptides provide further benefits with enantioenriched products ranging from 99 ee to 90 ee. At the same time, these catalysts exhibit lower selectivities than the simple 6, which stands in contrast to the 5-fold increase in selectivity observed with the prior catalyst 4.  The effect of the inactive residue on the enantioselectivity is unknown. However, it appears that there is some kinetic benefit to the catalystsubstrate assembly that is not yet fully understood. Also, the effect of substitution on the imineyon is not entirely clear. It is possible that all of the imine atoms in the -hang of the imine are oriented in
====================
To design more selective catalysts, specificty of the ligand was observed. As shown in, a change from D-Pro to Pro in the i 2 position resulted in a 1:5 ratio of 1 and 2, entry 5. Changing the i 2 residue from D-Pro to Pro led to a 1:5 ratio as well, entry 6. We noted that the mixed Ad-Cys moiety in the i 2 position was required for catalysis. Hence, we designed as table U73A-to-Lys-OH peptide to focus on a specific interaction within the molecule.  The result of the initial peptide library screening is shown in. The peptides appear to be more effective than the wild type for the resolution of alcohols. For example, methyl ketone -58 and -37 are obtained in the first and second place, indicating that the overreaction to form -58 and -37 is not justified by the data.  Further evidence for the efficacy of our catalysts was gathered by analyzing the recovery of -phenyl ester from the oxidation of alcohols. As shown in, when a stoichiometric amount of t-BuOK is employed, the reaction does not proceed. In addition, the reaction does not proceed when
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned to the interactive study of catalysts and substrates. Rather than simply recording the run numbers of reactions, we assessed each catalyst in the same category, as BINOL was used to evaluate the chirality of the catalyst.  At the outset of the study, we found that ee wax paramaters were readily incorporated in useful screens. With this knowledge in hand, we prepared a library of 20 tetrapeptides of varying length. Notably, peptides with yield and enantioselectivity in the direction opposite aldehyde moieties were observed. Long-standing trends in the Plex-E gel structure, in which the steric and electronic profiles of the naphthyl substituent and the trans substituent are globally varying, were identified. In accord with the previously reported methodology, we found that longer peptides gave higher ee values.  As shown in, a recent product of our lab has demonstrated that catalytic bromination reactions can be readily accomplished in aqueous solution. Accordingly, we envisioned that this technology could be readily applied to the synthesis of highly enantioselective, complexation materials.  Initially, we attempted to ICO a variety of trifluoromethyl
====================
To design more selective catalysts, as well as to seek to understand the effect of the C-terminal ester group on enantioselectivity.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our examination of the intramolecular McKeldings, we began with trimer 9 because of its similarity to a previous cyclization catalystood by Boc-Dmaa to give endo-tetrahydrofuran in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. After examining several additional peptides, peptide 10, with a TBS residue at the i3 position, was identified as a more selective catalyst, providing the product in 85 yield. The reaction was slower than the previous stages, but higher product yield was achieved in the second cycle.  Because TBS facilitated the development of six second-generation T-BS hydrochloride catalysts in the past decade, we prepared peptide 11 with its TBS-Protic and Deprotected Asn-Ala-Tyr-OH group. We envisioned that a seven-membered T-D-Phe-Thing might be a reasonable lead catalyst for the I, II-glycos
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we aimed to identify conditions to reduce the contact between the keying components of the catalyst and the alkenyl moiety of the substrate. We considered that the most likely sites of enantioselectivity would be targeted based on the geometries of the two-axis starting material and products following b-phosphonium elimination. We proposed that reducing the size of the C-terminal side chain would reduce the interaction between the catalyst and the side chain, and similarly, reducing the alkyl chain length would attenuate the interaction.  We began our studies by performing a series of control experiments. While representation of product distribution was statutory in nature, we discovered that the reaction rate could be substantially accelerated through the inclusion of various chiral phosphine catalysts. We therefore began with a study of chirality in the phosphine-and Amine-Strontated Steep.  We began by performing a series of control reactions. Using the same catalyst that we had previously developed, we were able to embed a tertiary amine-containing -dimethylaminoalanine residue within a peptide sequence that was expected to adopt a well-defined turn geometry. The size of the peptide sequence was chosen such that the

To design more selective catalysts, and to experimentally evidence after the screening events. In this context, we wondered if peptide-based catalysts could be found that could select enantiomers of product 418A within the stereospecific vicinity of the catalytic moiety. As a prelude to these studies, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new, enantioselective peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple catalysts represented an interesting template for the development of new enantioselective processes.  Our initial experiments established that indeed, the enantioselectivities of desymmetrizations were improved when states were localized to afford prochiral products. Of particular note, treatment of racemic p-penten-1-ol with 8 equiv of NBP produces the produce a-methoxy-2-pentenyl intermediate, which can be selectively disposed to the N-methyl group on the catalyst
====================
To design more selective catalysts, and to study the structure of selectivity in greater detail than would be practical in conventional microscope.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HNGC on ad ihydrobenzofuran residue at ca. 220 C. Since N-methylimidazole had been shown to be toxic to animals, we withheld from using it in our study. We also determined that acetonitrile was suitable for the reaction and enabled us to prepare products 13 and 14. After screening several preferentially prepared alkyl and heteroatom-containing substrates, we developed a protocol that resulted in selective formation of the C-succinimide product 15. The product of the reaction is formed via hydrolysis of the C-succinimide ad ihydrobenzofuran residue at 0C, which we estimated to be up to 85 ee.  The first example of a selective C-H olefination occurred
====================
To design more selective catalysts, loratadine and desloratadine, an even more reactive probe, were examined. Given the inherent reactivity of 1 toward indirect injection of aqueous ions, we anticipated that a diphenylsilyl-DIPAnion could be readily prepared and exploited as a stoichiometric probe in the event. Notably, many of the catalysts we screened possessed DIPAs, which exhibited significant selectivity for the 6, 7-position, not to easily accessible Tris H 2 O.  We next focused upon identifying a catalyst that selectively functionalizes the 3, 4-dichloro-2-phenyl ring of 1. While the approach of Lys-DIPSe is generally successful in these reactions, we were unaware of a catalytic cycle that requires a diol to functionalize a hydroxyl group at a stereogenic center.  We then turned our attention to the question of whether a catalytic cycle might be feasible. The method we had previously developed involved the addition of a diol to the Si-face of a diphenyl-DIPAnion. This compound, which bears a pendent diol, was expected to exhibit n f interactions between the diol and the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, sets of focused libraries of structure-selectivity that possess either 78 or 100 mg of the parent peptide were prepared. Screening of the unpurified catalysts at room temperature for the kinetic resolution of alcohol 3 resulted in selectivities that were substantially higher than the results of the control reactions. Upon re-screening, the selectivities for the kinetic resolution of alcohol 3 were restored to 50:1. 0. After re-screening, a second treatment of 75 nM -TMTBP was applied, and the reaction was stirred for 24 h. The solution was washed with 1 H and DCM. The organic layer was washed with 2 H and DCM, and the combined organics were dried over MgSO 4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified via flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 2-5 ethyl acetate hexanes to give a clear oil. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded. 5  The N-methyl imidazole carbamate was added to a solution of 2-methyl -4, 4-bis-imidazole in hexanes at room temperature. The resulting solution was allowed to stir at room temperature.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to library screening. We chose 150 peptides of our previously prepared L-Pro series of catalysts. Within our initial screen, we discovered that, in the presence of 6-phenylborinic acid, a variety of aliphatic ketones gave the product, 4-pregenoethylamine, with an especially high er of 84:16. In addition, in the presence of 2-phenylcyclohexanone, a number of aldehydes were converted to 2-phenylpropane, which upon treatment with TEMPO and sodium trifluoroacetate cured the remaining aldehyde.  The treatment of 4-pregenoethylamine with TEMPO and sodium trifluoroacetate offered one product in particular, which proved to be a 4:1 mixture of products. We observed that some of the products formed were quite similar to the structure of 5-6, which was prepared from 2-phenylcyclohexanone in the absence of a catalyst. However, when other catalysts were screened, such as DMAP and NMI, a 1:1 mixture of products was obtained. The site-selectivity of peptide 1
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we surmised that most boards would be symmetrical, thereby allowing for the central issymatic center to be sized appropriately. We hypothesized that, if the i2 residue could be replaced with a 4-bromo-substituted letter, the selectivity would be due to the relative stability of the two aliphatic rings.  We proposed that two modes of catalyst activation might be encountered in the enantioselective conjugate addition step: first, a level of enantioselectivity for the addition of an achiral substrate to a concomitantly formed enamine intermediate, followed by a second set of enantioselective protonation and oxidation followed by retronition to the product. While the details of the EAS mechanism are complex, we speculate that there is an underlying model that leads to enantioselectivity.  Specically, we reasoned that treatment of epoxide 9 with ethyl 2-pentenal in the presence of a tertiary amine-containing peptide would produce the need for a deprotection event. Since, Eryl-ketene affords a high probability of recovering having induced a deprotection event, we chose acid-
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined 13 C-labeled substrates. Since peptide 13 is biased to form a 3 10 -helix, we prepared appropriately labeled mCPBA and mixed it with the peptide. Within 1 h, the mCPBA mixture was mixed with a 0. 6:1 grailine-caramel syrup, which was then elaborated on 216.  An aliquot of the reaction mixture was taken, quenched with 1 H 2 O, and directly assayed by chiral GC analysis to determine krel values as previously reported. The results were used to calculate the k rel of o-Helical-type catalysts. All of the peptides analyzed adhered to the general structure, except that at the i2 position, where a free C-terminal carboxylic acid was found. In addition, the structure of 1retained from structure A.  On-Bead Directing and Catalyzed Total Synthesis of Proline. The solution structure of the mitomycin-like peptide was studied by construction of 1. In comparison to peptide 4, a number of trends emerged. First, the catalytic behavior of quinone-like catalyst 2 was restored to the degree that

To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as few as five transmission electrons into the halide atom of the i line. We believe that electron-rich arenes are generally favored for substitution on the A ring, although the results for the Drummersystem are quite varied. Therefore, we designed substrates
to test the ideas. These compounds were appealing since each possesses attributes for both independent oxidation reactions  could be compared as individual diastereomers could be obtained in its corresponding enantiopure form, in anticipation of the high degree of enantiospecificity exhibited in the reactions catalyzed by 1 and 2. 19, 20.  We felt that the best catalysts would likely be able to discriminate between the two possible structures because of the inherent conformational differences between the two. Accordingly, we targeted peptide-based catalysts that could perform the actual oxidation of the A ring.  Our initial study of aspartyl peptide-based catalysts was based on a catalytic cycle that employs an aspartyl peracids co-factor. The imagined catalyst would comproportionate with aspartyl iodide, which would activate the peracid toward S E Ar. Catalytic turnover of this cycle is aided by the presence of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the authors screened more than 20 different chiral phosphine catalysts in a diazirine-based phosphine library. The library was biased to contain a diazirine proximal to the catalytic residue, as well as chiral phosphorus and alkali-metal complexes. In addition to evaluating the wild-type effect of chirality on enantioselectivity, the authors screened a number of additional silyl-and alkyl-substituted residues near the proline residue to explore the stereochemical relationships within the catalyst. Intriguingly, the stereochemical outcome of the reactions best fit the profile of a D-Pro-Phe-OMe-type catalytic residue in the D-Pro-Phe-OH library did not align with the diazirine moiety.  The results of the studies suggested that Pro was unlikely to be the most stereogenic center in the peptide due to the C S N 2 -extramethyl-Pro-Asp-OMe structure, which lacks the pendant tertiary amine. However, as shown in, the pendant tertiary amine was formed and coupled with the diazirine in an enantiomeric

To design more selective catalysts, researchers turned to screening.  The results of the studies are presented in. As in their studies, the authors screened 201 triple helices that were capable of adopting -turns against a backdrop of DFM. The catalysts they examined were determined to be H-Ala-Ala-OH and H-Ala-D-Mel. The relative energies of the three structures were reconciled at the B97D36-31g level of theory, and the lowest energy conformer of the H-D-Pro is shown in.  Consistent with numerous biosynthetic studies, the structural features of 1, 2, and 3 suggest that a -turn is important for presynthesis. These observations are consistent with the presynthesis of aspartic acid as a multivalent complexed by a hydroxyl in the presence of alcohols and acyl chlorides.  The high energy of the H-D-Pro is consistent with the NMR data obtained for 2. The animal insulin, like other polyolazidases, undergoes DABCO formation to DABCH. The combined agents serve to protect the polyolide from degradation to the free amino acid. The insulin derivative H-D-Ala-

To design more selective catalysts, our research program focused on the additive effect, wherein the slight enantioselectivity in the formation of 1 could be compared to the ratio of the monoreduced products.  Our studies on the ratio of the monoreduced to the dibenzylamide-Pearl Effects.
revealed that the ratio of the monoreduced to the dibenzylamide was 1. 0:4. 0. Catalyst 4, which is containing a dialkyl group at the phenol position, gave a k rel 5. 2 in the same reaction as catalyst 3. This ratio decreased when the secondary amide group was replaced with a small amount of the primary amide, but still remained high when all four amides were included. The result was a strong preference for the dibenzylamide when all four amides were replaced with primary amide groups.  This result resonated with our hypothesis that the dibenzylamide could be a particularly good substrate for a hemiaminal ether-containing peptide catalyst. 
HBTU was added to a suspension of amide-and triethylamine-DMSO in dry CHCl3 at room temperature. The suspension

To design more selective catalysts, we turned to the screening of libraries of previously prepared catalysts.  Our initial screen of libraries of resins was based on a library of 6. 25, employing both 42 and 43 as launching units, and a 52-member tetrapeptide library. The following compounds were distinguished by 1 H NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry: compound 4. 28, which yields tribromide 4. 29 in 70 yield and 91:9 er, equivalent to a late-stage, possibly late-stage intermediate. Compound 4. 29, which also yields compounds 4. 31, can be converted to 4. 30 via several QA-mediated methylation steps. In this vein, catalyst 4. 28 was found to be competitive with pyridine as a substrate for the Aib-and Acpc- reactions. However, peptide 4. 29 was found to be less selective than pyridine, providing 4. 31 in 45:55 er.  Mystodemonstration of the potentially powerful effect of bifunctional catalysis on enantioselective catalysis is a result of the wellknown binding of N-terminal prolyl peptides to their substrates. The phosphopeptide
====================
To design more selective catalysts, an internal recommendation that emerged during the initial studies of libraries of resin-bound compounds is that compounds holding 4 or 6 at the endo position should be converted to them at building rate by taking advantage of the well-precedented data that compounds like BPH 6 and BINAP 6 derive from matramidal compound-mixture. Taking this approach, Sanford and co-workers merged photoredox catalysis with a copper catalyst to deliver H-Myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate as a single regioisomer. The seamless incorporation of acetylenes into the prenylated glycerol core of 1 was accomplished by employing 3-electrophile arylation to provide the corresponding aliphatic aldehyde, which was then coupled to the copper catalyst. Under standard conditions, the aliphatic aldehyde and methyl vinyl ketone were converted to the corresponding alkyl-substituted compound H-Myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate in a single operation. The seamless integration of octapeptide 7 with the copper and photoredox catalyst was accomplished without loss in efficiency.  A major area in which oxidative photoredox catalysis
====================
To design more selective catalysts, A and B were removed from the pool of catalysts to which they were added, and a new library of tetrapeptide catalysts was generated. From this library, the peptides were obtained, and their structures were determined. These peptides were then evaluated in the ring-opening DKR of oxazolone 5. In comparison to the parent substrate, the epoxide product of this reaction was obtained in 36 yield, 93:7 dr in favor of the anti-isomer, and 87 ee. Furthermore, all of the catalysts tested in the atroposelective ring-opening DKR of oxazolone 5 were able to catalyze the reaction with >50 ee.  This higher selectivity for the anti-product, 35 percent in particular, led us to explore the role of the secondary structure of the peptide. In the structure of the erythromycin A derivative, the three aromatic rings of the catalyst are aligned with a yellow X-ray crystal. To compare the two environments, we modeled the structures of peptides 10. 27 using the work of Hall. These structures, along with the crystal structure of 10. 27, reveal three interconnected compartments that are likewise directed toward
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the authors elected to develop the screening framework as a three-stereoisomer library, wherein the i1 and i2 residues were fixed and the N-terminal and nucleophilic residues were varied. They intended to use either Demks or Evanss catalyst to reach the more stable iminium intermediate, which is the more catalytically generated iminium ion. However, the proposal that the i2 residue may be replaced with a free carboxylic acid was rejected.  The N-terminal and electrophilic Residues. The resulting tribrominated products were isolated in good yields and high selectivities. The high ers and yields obtained with the non-dibrominated compounds defined as 5, 6-benzylidene were obtained with the highest er values.  Recognizing the increased potency and sensitivity of Hepatid to N-terminal substitution, related to the observed increase in the clearance of drug through increased H 2 binding to the drug.  The highest o-acetyl-H 2 binding was also observed.  To probe the effect of the i3 residue, the JOC curve was constructed and centered at 100. 0. The point at the i3 position was considered
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we had observed early that the cis-1, 3-diol was rate-determining. When --1-diol was treated with Ru 3 2, the resulting Ru 3 IMes was trapped by the naphthyl group of the pyridinium ring. Ru 3  may then oxidize -1-dithiol, giving diol 4. The cyclic iminium ion 4 may then be intercepted by a variety of scaffolds, including alkynes. The resulting byproducts are thus the previously discussed.  The prospect of developing catalysts that could selectively functionalize analogues intrigued us. Notably, the trifluoromethyl group afforded little to no selectivity in the reaction of aldehydes with a variety of imine substrates.  The basis of the selectivity induced by the steric effect stimulated an examination of the aryl trifluoromethyl ketal moiety as a point of comparison. β 2 Me, N-methylaniline, and 3-methylene-2-norbornanone were tested as catalyst precursors, and each was found to afford modest enantioselectivity. The first two catalysts,
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned to the iodoarene design principle. Indeed, after evaluation of the iodoarene library, we observed that the majority of catalysts were implying a 3 10 -helix structure, with some variation. The alternative structural types tended to favor the presence of the nonhelical type I -turn in slight percentages.  Next, we decided to investigate the effect of the i2 residue on selectivity. We reasoned that if the stoichiometric residue were characterized as a type II -hairpin, with a G behind the C-terminus, then an increased concentration of the complexed material around the NC-urea carbonyl would result. Thus, we introduced a degree of leeway at the i2 position, placing tetrapeptide catalysts in the hands of catalysts that both afforded net retention of structure would result.  While stimulating, it is important to note that the majority of catalysts in this study, including those shaped after the model reaction of 4-between-aminoquinoline and 1, 4-dicyanobenzene, were structurally fabricated in a 3 10 -helix. Thus, we thought that increasing the helical length to 300-fold increase the diversity of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in an iterative manner. Consideration of the structurelibrary led us to the hypothesis that Boc-Pro was a likely lead catalyst due to its cognizance of the Boc-Pro repeat in the S2 series. However, unfortunately, sequence B showed no evidence of a doublein reaction, as the major product in the second step of the cycle is the dimer Boc-Pro, which bears no resemblance to a doublein product. The structure of any lead catalyst could be correlated to the Dmaa residue at the i3 position, as this sequence may provide a vantage into the transition state. At this point, we wished to investigate the role of the tert-butyl-Hyp residue by examining the reaction between N-acetylglucosamine and 4-Hypophenylglucosamine. We were intrigued to find that treatment of 4-Hyp with t-BuOOH affords Dmaa-Hyp, which bears a pendent Dmaa residue at the i3 position. When the pendent Dmaa residue is joined in Asp-containing peptides, such as those discussed in Section 7. 1, the selectivity trends are observed to decrease slightly. For 5-Hyp,
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to involve as little as possible about the use of sensitive functional groups, such as backbone amides. We thus targeted -turn-biased sequences, which can be afforded by incorporation of either L-or D-Pro in the i and i1 positions, as we have observed that these residues tend to nucleate copy-instructures. In fact, peptides containing the D-Pro residue at the i1 position were 4x more selective than those containing L-Pro. The effect of backbone length was next evaluated. Notably, one-to three-membered ring H-D-Pro contained a quinoline, ghanaine, and alkynylalanine in the same diastereomeric series. As such, we hypothesized that the presence of D-Pro in the i1 position might be representative of a left-handed, type II -turn in the presence of a suitable h-D-Pro.  While many experiments supported the hypothesis that peptide 2. 38 catalyzes the formation of a left-handed quinoline, a number of limitations were identified. First, the terribly substrate-dependent nature of this process necessitates that substrate 1. 25 be converted to 2. 29 in a high
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we aimed to develop 6.5 molar equivalents of proline. This is 10 times more concentrated than proline, so it is likely that multiple minisubstrate interactions contribute to the overall performance of methyl esters.  We questioned whether the -turn could be preserved by downsizing the side chain residue. Through examination of the solution structures of peptides 4. 29, peptide 4. 30, and 4. 31, we were able to find that, despite the many substituents, the 3-position was the most-reactive residue. Therefore, we chose it as the next target of this study.  The results of our studies are presented in. As in the case of the 4. 29, there is a significant increase in selectivity as compared to that observed with the simple catalysts. The upturned face of the dendritic backbone, in the presence of -TRIP, becomes much less sterically accessible, in an arrangement that is less favorable than the upraised face.  In the case of the 3-catalyzed bromination of 5. 31, Yates and co-workers achieved the bromination of -5. 32 atrinity to the dibromide, affording
====================
To design more selective catalysts, these researchers sought to better differentiate the reactivity among the different alcohols on the same substrate. They proposed a model in which the C7 alcohol runs afresh over the entire fingerprint, becoming more hydrophobic and less acyclogenic.  Using a fluorescence assay, the fluorescence signal of a product towards product C1 could be detected by fluorescence. While a 1:1 ratio of product C1 to product C2 was observed, the ratio was reversed and amplified using a two-reversed system. Both R-and R-phenyl alcohols gave a nearly 1:1 ratio of products C1 and C2. After recrystallization of the samples, fluorescence signatures were assigned and combined with the data to identify the most selective catalyst. Upon evaluating 25 different catalysts, peptide C2 emerged as the lead catalyst. To confirm that C2 was indeed the natural product, a small sample of C2 that was soluble in methylene-d 6 and methanol was dissolved in 250 mM Tris HCl and heated to 70C. The sample was sealed and stored at 0C.  Evaluation of Intriguing Structures by Oxidation. In analogy to the concept explored using perox
====================
To design more selective catalysts, such as peptides that may allow for 100, 000 to 250, 000 stereocenters, a daunting task given the plethora of simple, cheap, and readily available nucleophiles.  Despite the immense challenge afforded by the abundance of highly functionalized peptides, several classes of selectivity have emerged that overcome the
problems that arise from stoichiometric activators. After examining 100 peptides of varying chain lengths, we observed a class of peptides that exhibited a modicum of selectivity for the 6, 7-position, with results that ranged from 1 to 10.  The sequence of the peptide, 148 as well as the identity of the prochiral substituent within the -turn-motif, were determined by X-ray crystallography. The presence of the phenylalanine moiety within the catalyst was confirmed by chemical correlation.  The range of selectivity that we observed, in comparison to the flat-coated enzymatic catalysts, was modest. However, our previous studies of related peptide-based catalysts had suggested that peptide-based catalysts could overcome problems in the complementary way in the face of an equally competent catalyst in the absence of a coenzyme. When a
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we carried out a brief study on the intramolecular Stetter class.  In analogy to the findings of the cysteine-promoted cycloaddition studies, we examined if the species transmitted via the cysteine-promoted stetter could be radial. Because of the internal H-Ala of these compounds, we suspected that, when a sterically condenser was employed within the steric confines of the catalyst, the iminium species 2. 46 was poised to undergo selective a-carbonyl alkylation.  To test this hypothesis, we designed tetrapeptide catalyst 4. 46b to bind to the iminium ion. In this arrangement, the naphthyl group on the catalyst would serve to introduce steric bulk to the tetrapeptide catalyst, which would then activate the a-iminium ion. We hypothesized that, if a b-turn were present in the reaction, a b-turn could serve as a carrier. Indeed, peptide 4. 46b was found to catalyze the a-iminium a-sterosion of a 2. 10:1 mixture of 2. 11:1. 0. 99. The rate of the reaction was
====================
To design more selective catalysts, Mori and co-workers sought to find a more biomimetic strategy that might afford products with increased levels of enantiocontrol. The authors found that titanium tetrachloride was an efficient catalyst for both the reduction of alkyl bromide and the addition of water to trifluoromethylenedicyanoimide. As in the reduction of alkyl bromide, the use of 2-3-penten-1-ol afforded marginally decreased selectivity for the desired product 4a in comparison to the use of 2-acetyl-propane-1, 3-diol. The addition of water was found to be beneficial when utilizing the canonical reaction mixture in order to prevent competitive halogenation of the bromoarenes.  Indeed, the selectivity of the reaction was significantly improved when the reaction was conducted in water, presumably because of the hydrophobic effect. An additional registry of products that were produced by this enantioselective halogenation protocol was found to be 1. 0:3. 0 e. r. , which corresponds to a relative rate constant ratio of the fast enantiomer to the slow enantiomer of 1. 7:
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to retain the ability of the proline residue to act as a catalyst via a more nucleophilic reaction pathway. Indeed, we tethered proline to provide a helical secondary structure to provide a pavilion structure that was wide and flat.  Indeed, the pThr-containing catalyst -Turn7 affect the selectivity to provide the product in 45:55 er and 63:37 er, respectively. The er of the major product was affected by the helical structure of the pThr residue, which has proven particularly influential in drug design. The stereochemistry of the pThr residue was also probed through the use of DPro-Pro-Asp-phenyl as a catalyst. In this case, the pThr residue itself was found to be highly influential, providing the major product in 65:35 er. The er of the minor product was also significantly higher, but by only 3:74.  catalysts of varying chain lengths, we observed similar trends. Of the dFx catalysts that afforded moderate er, those with lengths between eight and 10 amino acids afforded the product with the highest er. We observed that catalysts of the n chain gave modest increases in selectivity, as compared
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we studied 99 peptides of the initial screening library in the site-selective acylation of substrate 1. Screening of the unpurified catalysts at room temperature for the kinetic resolution of alcohol 3 resulted in a library of 99 highly selective catalysts, including some that were functionalized with product 4. Others, including many that were functionalized with product 4, proved to be much less selective. For example, catalyst 6, with D-Pro in the i 1 position, afforded a k rel 50. However, when peptide 11 was employed, the reaction resulted in a kinetically controlled mixture of products, with only trace amounts of product 5.  To assess the extent to which the steady-state kinetics measured among the initial 99 catalysts differ from those advanced with product-functionalized peptides, we conducted a screen of 20 additional catalysts developed in our earlier studies. When a focus of 126 reactions was employed, the product distribution delivered was markedly improved. Outstanding yields of product 5 were maintained at 90-97 conversion, comparable to the result of earlier reactions. Interestingly, yield of the reaction increased modestly when acetamide was employed, presumably because the longer peptide bonded to the alcohol.  It is noteworthy that
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to identify factors such as the exhibited increase in selectivity. A number of interesting features of the catalysts we have observed are of interest. First, the overall product distribution delivered under the randomized conditions is similar to the national average, although the ratio of products to beginnings is quite high. Second, we felt that auto-oxidation of the beginning material on the presence of a strong base could be a fruitful avenue for the et al. In this vein, we were inspired by the contrast between a acetamide and a primary amine.  While many experiments supported the efficacy of the catalysts in high enantioselectivities, one stood out as a notably better hit, i nt he case of 5-HBP.  With this solution in hand, we prepared azepine 1. Azide 71 was prepared from N-methyl-N-phenylpiperazine, and an aliquot was distributed under an Ar atmosphere to the reaction vessel. P eptide 72, with a trans-3-hydroxy-propyl amide at the C-terminus, was found to be a highly selective catalyst, delivering azide 73 in 18 ee. Considering that the rate of reaction was similar to that
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we often succeed in our studies by designating roles to selectivity that we desire. The hallmark of the successful cases is the substantial enrichment of the biologically relevant product in relation to the quantity of the reactive substrates. Indeed, this approach often enables the discovery of new therapeutic agents that are otherwise difficult to access by other means.  Recently, we hypothesized that the selective and staged oxidation of 1 might be possible as a result of a catalytic cycle wherein the oxidant undergoes transient absorption and thereafter undergoes -bond reorganization. Notably, we believed that honey might be an ideal scaffold for this rational goal because of the propensity of neopentyl nucleophiles to populate chairlike transition states. The present study appears to follow this trend despite the far less evolved nature of the catalytic cycle.  First, we began a vice-presence study of the stone-catalyzed oxidation of 1. In analogy to the work of MacMillan, we began by observing that the use of dibromodimethylhydantoin as a methylating reagent could disfavor any undesired side reactivity, as shown in the treatment of alcohol oxidation. 2 Moreover, the use of less than 3 equiv of H
====================
To design more selective catalysts, generally we sought to develop systems or applications that would exploit natural abundance as well as incorporate acid chlorides and carboxylic acids.  Our initial target for synthesis was ent-PI, as depicted in. PI3P-A stable imide was originally anticipated to be a likely choice for diversifying the PLC-PLC en route to high-PI natural products. On the basis of the demonstrated ability of phospholipids to catalyze enantioselective phosphorylation reactions, we prepared a range of chiral phospholipids of varying steric demand at the 6 0 -600 M level.  Our initial attempts to enrich the PI3P-A stable imide resulted in formation of a mix of products, which included a significant amount of the desired phosphate and some significant amounts of the thermopolymitosane. Upon treatment of the mixed phosphoinositides with Ac 2 O and TFA at room temperature, the mix was purified using electrophilic chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 1 to 100 EtOAcHex to yield a mostly pure mixture of 6 0 -600 M. The mix was suspended in methanol, which dissolves all of the p$$$ = P
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a library of resin-bound compounds containing one or more direct access to drug-like molecules. Taking a first-order analysis of the HPLC traces of the reactions, we observed a significant linear correlation between the p ( and the drug: the more concentrated peaks were observed, the higher the slope. Reactions involving the polymer-bound diols were more likely to exhibit the modulated landscapes shown in, as the drugs were racemic, while the results of the reactions involving the diols are pure.  Observed as the p-substituted diols are differentially active, we classified them as anlel-substituted ketones. We also observed that the drug -dioxyaldehyde undergoes catalysis with a lower pK a value than the corresponding alcohol.  The combination led to a screen of 15 additional peptide catalysts targeted to identify a more selective catalyst. Following the peptide identification, we synthesized a series of dibromocarbonyls with the structure of filter-dibromide 16. Screening of the unpurified catalysts at room temperature for the kinetic resolution of alcohol 3 resulted in selectivity factors that ranged from 1 to 10.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the authors considered a library of 150 tetrapeptide catalysts that are capable of adopting -turns. Within the library, the catalysts were designed to adopt either type II or type II turns depending on whether Dmaa or Erya was at the i and i1 positions. Across the entire library, the peptides were evaluated in the enantioselective epoxidation of oxazolone 1. Ramachandran and co-workers had previously shown that the epoxidation of oxazolones could be mediated by the presence of a Dmaa-Dmaa type II catalyst. In addition to oxazolone 1, many other oxazolones were also examined. In general, the catalysts were designed to adopt type IIII or type IIII turns depending on the Dmaa-Dmaa or type IIIIdpeptide backbone. The catalyst derived from peptide 42, which possesses the Glu residue at the i2 position, delivered the epoxide 49 in higher conversion and selectivity. Indeed, peptide 42 was found to be a highly selective catalyst for the epoxidation of 49, providing the only product in the low range of the ester. The
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to embrace as little bit of the diversity of the mixtures in order to achieve as high ee as possible. We therefore attempted to mimic the achiral genome of 4.  We envisioned that a single-bead screening of a library of resin-bound compounds could provide a data-driven discovery of a patch of dei-5. Though difficult, such a strategy has three advantages: the library is diverse, the chemistry is well understood, and the observation of non-intuitive trends in the data allows for the reconstruction of a self-consistent binding model.  Our study began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetterification of Methacrylic Acid. Our goal was to develop a resin-bound, peptide-catalyzed kinetic resolution of alcohols that would result in monocoupled product 6. As a benchmark of the success of our polymer-binding studies, we examined "phenylboronic acid derivative 8, which bears the smallest substituent at the 6 0 -position. Under our reaction conditions, at 24C penten-1-ol afforded exclusively the 2, 3-dipolar product 9 in 75 ee, which proved to be highly reproducible on a millig
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the goal became to identify reactivity at extremely proximal sites within the catalyst. These, presumably, are the most likely locations to non-sequential catalysts.  Our studies began by identifying a type of amide-and ester-based phosphine-based catalyst for the kinetic resolution of a series of racemic tert-butanes. In our initial studies, we made use of a Pmh-embedded peptide catalyst containing the catalytic residue L--Met-Tyr-DPro-Aib-Phe-NMe 2. After screening 423 individual reaction vessels, we observed a trend toward the formation of a selectivity for the resolution of alcohol 5. Catalyst 4 produced a k rel 50 for the resolution of alcohol 5. Given the accuracy of that initial screening trends, we devoted additional resources to identification of the best catalysts. On the screening of new catalyst libraries, we again observed a trend toward increased selectivity for the resolution of alcohols.  Later, we discovered that catalyst 6. Others had similarly adopted the screening strategy, but to a lesser extent, and a different approach was required. A library of 18 complex, drug-like precursor compounds was subjected to the reaction conditions. After 36 conversion to
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a pThr-based catalyst with the appended sequence of peptides 3 and 16. Compared to peptide 3, the pThr-based catalyst 16 gives a somewhat formula-Y balance of products, with a product distribution of 63:37. On the other hand, peptide 17 provides a nearly formula-Z ratio of products, with only 27
phenol and 45:55.  We conclude at this stage that the formula-based distribution of catalysts may be bordering on ideal. However, in the face of the adequately strong case for the l-Pro-Aib sequence in the i2 position, we found that the path to endomorphin-2-overcomes the -recombination of two smallish peptides. This result, while embodying itself a synthesis of -morphin-2, represents a significant advance in the formula-bundle distribution for the nonenzymatic catalytic peptide.  E. V.

====================
To design more selective catalysts, we targeted to develop catalysts that would produce unique atropisomers selectively. We were particularly intrigued by the prospect of discovering atropisomerism in the presence of a chiral amine catalyst. Given the demonstrated ability of certain pyridine-containing peptides to catalyze enantioselective reactions, we sought to develop a pyridine-containing catalyst that might exhibit enhanced atropisomeric properties.  We thus began by synthesizing a series of pyridine-containing peptides. Every other ingredient in the reaction was readily prepared from its corresponding amine. The peptides were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry and by Hiemstra et al. , who provided *P1 for the pyramidal distribution of the pyridines in the central community. Shown in Scheme 1 is a fluorescence micrograph of a portion of a spherical 50-mL round-bottom flask. Five beads surrounded by halos of fluorescence were placed close together, and each was exposed to a 4 M solution of dibromodimethylhydantoin in DMF. The flask was sealed with a septum, and a N 2 inlet was added. The reaction mixture was allowed
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as little information as possible about the stereochemical identity of the prochiral substituent. As shown in, if the colorless gels were exposed to 2 equiv of TMSBr, the most selective catalyst in the series, emine 6, was produced in 29 yield. In this case, the previously reported enantioselectivity in the emine 6 was enhanced to 33 ee.  Given the heightened activity of recently reported enantioselective peptide-based catalysts, we wanted to establish whether the enantioselectivity observed was due to an accelerative process rather than a decelerative interaction. Therefore, we analyzed the activities of five catalysts that differ only at one enantiomeric position.  It is well known that the residue at the i 1 position can be replaced with a ketone to produce a farnesol product with high enantioselectivity. Therefore, we designed several catalysts based on this catalyst structure, including two that are sensitive to the steric effect.  We found that the use of 6TCA as the reaction medium was beneficial, as congestion of the reaction mixture increases the rate of the reaction. Moreover, we found that the use
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as little functionality as possible into the spaced 12 amino acid bonds. We thus positioned isoapletor a-amino alcohol atoms at the N-terminus of our screen-affected peptides. We chose 150 as a representative library. resynthesized, activated, and screened using the approach of resynthesis.  After screening 152 catalysts, peptide 121 was found to provide a 1:5 ratio for 213 and 215. The EZ-Pro-Asp-Ala-OH reaction is strongly substrate-dependent, and difficulty in making the final product is compounded by the hydroxyl group loss at the tertiary 2-position.  Since the 5-position is presumed to be sterically capable of shielding any other functional group from going through the endo, only the popcorn and mering complex could be obtained. In this vein, the reaction between ayu and acetophenone was similarly sluggish and gave similar results.  Further efforts were made to optimize the reaction conditions. Eventually, the reaction was suspended in methanol and allowed to stir at 0C for 16 h. After 48 h, the resulting solution was poured into 1:1 THF and concentrated in vacuo. The crude reaction
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we targeted to develop catalysts that would produce stereoselective copies of the starting material. We were particularly attracted to the compounds derived from collagen, as their aldol counterparts would provide a useful platform for combined efforts. We thus targeted peptide-based catalysts that could form diastereomeric, enantiopure proteins.  We began by embedding the i3 amide in a peptide sequence that was expected to adopt a well-defined turn geometry. Our initial studies into the trifluoromethylation of allylic alkenes relied on the use of substrates that dual catalyze trifluoromethylation at double-point in order to achieve the least initial impact. Double-point synthesis, however, requires continuous application to the synthesis of high-complexity proteins. The importance of a BDNF motif to cellular biology was demonstrated by its adoption by the cell lines. 10 Efforts to incorporate a BDNF residue in our start material were unsuccessful, as numerous substituents were found to decrease overall chirality. Moreover, compounds possessing an amine, ester, and amide capabilities all failed to catalyze the reaction.  In an effort to find a positive effect
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as many biochemical functions as possible.  While many experiments supported the strong correlation between the hypothesis and the observed results, one element that has consistently been identified in these studies is the potential for multiple, multiple-catalyst reaction. Indeed, the authors often demonstrate that, even in the complex environment of a natural product, the specific function of the phenol moiety can be varied.  As shown in, a wide array of differentially substituted bphenylcyclohexanones can be coupled with 2. 5 equiv of nucleophilic amino acid. While all of the can be two-catalyst cyclic tosyloxyketones, few examples with enals and electron-deficient olefins as well as nitriles are known. The authors report that in 1977, Nieto and Perkins reported that, in the presence of triethylamine, a variety of chiral phosphines were effective chiral ligands for a variety of asymmetric reactions. Significantly, in an attempt to replicate the success of those studies, the authors discovered that a chiral phosphine, which is fundamental to life, was capable of catalyzing the asymmetric addition of aldehydes to enones at elevated
====================
To design more selective catalysts, several parameters were explored in the search for ways to improve the cycle. First, a library of 18 tetrapeptides was synthesized, as described in Scheme 1. In this library, four serine and threonine residues were included, as well as an alanine residue at the N-terminus. The rest of the peptides were synthesized using a similar strategy, except with a trans-4-acetyl-lysine residue at the i2 position. In this case, the i2 was functionalized with a cis-cyclopropane-vancomycin conjugate instead of a peptide. Notably, this approach may enable the preparation and evaluation of up to 20 more potent antibacterial peptides.  In addition to the library of peptide catalysts, a live cell of E. coli was also treated with a mixture of peptides containing the sequence Boc-Pmh-Aib-D-Phe-OMe, which resulted in the formation of a significant amount of the desired product. However, survival of the microhelix-addition product was poor, as evidenced by the lack of correlation between steric size and product ee.  To identify a more active and
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we now know that -turn secondary structures can play critical roles in signal transduction and cognition. In this sense, the synthetic application of the Hague is indeed an exciting horizon, given the capacity of amines to catalyze enantioselective reactions.  However, a principal challenge in the field of asymmetric catalysis for organic synthesis is the retention of rigidity in the face of increased complexity. As a result, traditional, C-functionalized organocatalysts are often effective in conveying rigidity to substrates that lack the ability to homodimerize the corresponding alkyl radicals. 15 Efforts to achieve a more organized substrate class based on antichiral factors, which are often potent in femaleimide-mediated reactions, have thus far proven unsuccessful. As a result, conventional, C-functionalized catalysis remains a formidable task.  We recently questioned whether the catalytic principle of BINAP could be translated to the more complex DKR of enone 7. As revealed in Scheme 1, we hypothesized that exposure of R-phenylidene to a range of amine catalysts could lead to a 1:1 ratio of R:R. The resultant enamine 7. As a result,
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we again turned to combinatorial screening.  Since the catalyst discovery process shares its signature odor, we chose several simple derivatives of 1 as a scaffold for screening. Our initial reaction discovered that selenocysteine is a far superior catalyst to bis 1 and, perhaps, all other reaction intermediates that contain 2.  We then turned our attention to the issue of enantioselectivity. We define enantioselectivity as a ratio of enanti to the product of enanti-king, where k rel is based on the kinetic order of product, which is known as the relative ratios of product:unintentionalized small molecule to m-phenylethanol. For leucine derivatives, we chose a different approach. We chose to develop a focused library of small peptides containing residues with nonide-terminal active "esto afford a set of catalysts with enantioselectivities. Because peptides possess the ability to exhibit multiple functional groups in the same space, we studied these catalysts at the engagement of various substrates. We chose to examine tetrapeptide 7, which, like the pentapeptide catalyst, possesses a catalytic Pro residue at the i2 position. Upon evaluation
====================
To design more selective catalysts, presented a number of design opportunities. As is well-known from previous work that Pd is an ideal cysteine-based catalyst for the High Accuracy Investigation of Extensive Enantioselective Pathways. Given the extensive diversity of structure and structure available to highly active Pd-catalyzed molecules, we wished to extend this catalyst to the synthesis of other complex pyrrolidine ring systems.  As shown in, we envisioned that a cysteine-containing peptide could be efficient and produce a wide variety of Cys-Pd cations under favorable conditions. Notably, many of the same design principles that we employed in the Critical Design of Enantioselective Serum Albumidases was also applied to these systems, to enable reVersible Crystallization and Parallel Preparation of Peptide Catalyzed Oxidation to Cys145.  Our initial studies endeavored to define reaction conditions that would lead to stereoselectivity. We examined the stereochemical relationship between substituents on the catalyst framework and the monoepoxide enantiomer that would be formed. Furthermore, we determined that the enantiomer ratio of the reaction could be regulated as a function of the reaction temperature. We found that
====================
To design more selective catalysts, this study was followed by a mechanistic investigation that stimulated hypotheses about a possible nonheme iron-catalyzed macrolide-to-substituted catalyst system.  The natural material studied was harvested by irrigation of the crops with phenylchlorination of the produce, followed by automatic normal-phase flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 40 to 100 EtOAcHex, yielding a fine mixture of product. The problem of enantioselectivity in this reaction was identified as a result of the formation of a complex of catalyst and substrate that contained traces of the two alkenyl catalysts that were required.  The most selective catalyst in the series, D1-O, possesses a tertiary amine moiety at the 2-position, and shows comparable selectivity to hit catalyst D1-O. However, the Macrocycle B, which does not contain a secondary amine, yields only 10 ee.  It is likely that the ee of 1 is due to the net reduction of the alkenyl radical to the alkene.   Although the two structurally similar catalyst classes are differentiated, there are likely many, as there are many ways to draw inspiration from nature. It
====================
To design more selective catalysts, tailored to meet the unique requirements of a specific substrate, we undertook the total synthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor 12, a drugs precursor that was developed for the treatment of ADHD. As shown in Scheme 3, we estimated that a 60:40 ratio of triethylamine and its monocyclic isopropyl alkyl anion would be optimal. Clear from this analysis was that the choice of an amine source could significantly affect the overall performance of this alkylation method.  Having identified a tripeptide catalyst 6 that is capable of delivering product 4 in 78 ee at 40 ee, we sought to define the scope of the aryl halide component. As shown in, a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse arenes readily tolerated on the aryl ring, including electron-rich and electron-deficient arenes. Moreover, the reaction was extended to include substituted allenoates, which are commonly used in the synthesis of druglike molecules.   Because the 4f diastereomers proved difficult to isolate from the reaction mixture, we analyzed the reaction outcome. Crude mixtures of the starting material and product were combined, concentrated, and dried on high vacuum to afford approx
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the library. We analyzed the library from start to finish, and within 24 h, we observed a 4:1 ratio of 1 and 2. 0:18. 0:1. 0. Modifications to the i2 residue, such as replacement of the benzyl protecting group with a trityl group or removal of the -turn element resulted in diminished selectivity. Replacement of the ethereal O-benzyl with an ethyl group still produced a measurable amount of selectivity, although it was attenuated.  At this stage, we wondered what the additional functionality in the i2 position might contribute to the binding of 1 to 3. Because we had heard the call of Gabenzyl about his earlier work in the Valsartan metabolite, we assigned the alkyl chain to be L-proline and to O- -serine. The L-isostere to the i2 carbamate was replaced with a larger benzyl indole moiety, leading to a further increase in enantiocontrol. Moreover, lowering the reaction temperature to 0 C afforded a higher 6:5 ratio, whereas at 30 C the selectivity was reversed. The er rose from 66:34
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we surveyed the reactivity between the amine and the prochiral center substituent. We found that a majority of the amines are inert to proline catalysis, providing the corresponding ketones with useful er values.  The ketone iminium ion hydrolyzes iminium ion 6 to deliver iminium ion 7. The resulting -amino ketone is oxidized to The Journal of Organic Chemistry Article prochiral aldehyde to afford iminium ion 8. The resulting -amino aldehyde may be treated with 9-methoxyphenylketone to afford p-nitrophenyl ester 10. The addition of hypromethane to the iminium ion at room temperature provides the -benzyl aldehyde, which is oxidized to The Journal of Organic Chemistry Article drlikelihood that emanates from the catalyst.  Our initial target for synthesis was ent-PI3P- in order to examine the effect of steric bulk on the targeting iminium ion. We expected that adding of the fourth DIPO group to the P-I in the presence of a conventional iminium salt would favor the iminium ion hydrolysis pathway
====================
To design more selective catalysts, they studied the reactivity of -TRIP toward a variety of amines 1. 20. Upon reacting -TRIP with a broad range of amines 1. 23, ferric ion 1. 29, and a variety of amine catalysts 1. 29, primary amine 1. 25, and secondary amine 1. 26. Notably, while the use of primary amine catalysts has a significant effect on selectivity, secondary amine catalysts offer a complementary approach, to give almost identical yields of product 1. 23.  The N-methylimidazole1. 25 was originally developed for the bifunctional activation of 1. 30. The corresponding primary amine 1. 31 was synthesized to elicit a type II hairpin H-bond between the NH and O. This H-bond between the primary and secondary amines plays a catalytic role in the transition state. In the absence of a primary amine, less reactive amines, such as N-phenylpyrrolidine and the free amine of 1. 28, were used in the reaction. While these amines modulate the reaction rate, they generally provide higher yields of product 1. 23.  Shortly
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we assessed the reactivity of a common imine by a small aliphatic ketone relative to N-methylimidazole at similar ketone concentrations.  Our initial attempts to implement the trans-iminium strategy met with little success. During the course of our studies, we recognized that proper preparation of the benzyl disubstituted ester could be a problem. Because we had attempted to optimize the reaction using 9-pregnanedione, we found that the use of the methyl vinyl ketone at 0C afforded the product in excellent yield, albeit with low enantioselectivity. The reaction did become more programmable after recrystallization, and at 30 C, -toluenes could be employed to access the m-methoxy-substituted tetracyclic cyclopentene.  -Amino Acid-derived Germonsiomer. The roots of our tripeptide-based catalysts often include a binary selection of 15 common nucleophiles, including glycopeptides from the natural product sresus. In our experience, we were surprised to find that the simple reaction of honey-pumped anthrone with methyl vinyl ket
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we chose the -turn as the central element of our study. The reason for this choice is that the serine and threonine residues would be directly adjacent to one another on the carbon carbon framework of our evaluation substrate. If the two residues were distal from one another, we could potentially prevent the formation of six-membered-ring cyclizations due to the potential for racemization caused by the brushable surface of the i1 Pro residue.  Thus, we initially concerned that the i2 Thr might, in fact, be involved in a directing hydrogen-bond. This possibility bodes well for future studies of Threonine-and Leu-containing peptides. Even so, one idea in our laboratory was that the histidine residue might be involved in a directing hydrogen-bond, leading to selective furanylation of the C-terminal functional group.  The fourteen highly deprotected peptides were treated with 15-fold increase in Curcibutan-DIM, and at this concentration range the shorts were distributed in a ratio of 1:2. 5:1. 0. Modifications of the i2 residue, such as replacement of the benzyl protecting group with a trityl group
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we questioned whether or not the stereochemistry of the prochiral substituent could be preserved. By extension of this finding to hydroxyl group differentiation, we believe this finding represents a further example of selectivity for the 6, 7-olefin within the context of a 3:1 mixture.  The search for low-molecular-weight asymmetric catalysts has spawned the development of many interesting compounds that function as enantioselective catalysts. Amino acid and peptide-based catalysts offer intriguing analogies to enzymatic systems. Their reliance on similar conformational determinants and functional group arrays are reminiscent of those present in protein-based catalysts. In this context, we report an experimental study of an effective catalyst that diverges from a well-known class of previously reported catalysts for the asymmetric epoxidation of the ethereal drink 3.  Our interest in studying this catalyst began with an examination of its performance on a scale of relevance to the synthesis of enone 4. We were able to observe that the reaction between 4-methoxybenzyl ester and methyl 3-butenoate takes place with net retention of anomeric configuration, despite the incorporation of atrop
====================
To design more selective catalysts, our focus now turned toward the synthesis of unsymmetrical bis- 3.  In recent studies our lab has demonstrated that the interplay of the unique reactivity between enone substrates and means of delivery can be highly diverse. For example, in a study of the interfacial use of chiral copper complexes as chiral ligands for metal-catalyzed cross-couplings, we observed that this copper complex, which is highly regioselective, is able to enable enantioselective cross-couplings with enones that do not readily participate in iminium formation. For example, in the presence of H 2 O and a complex mixture of CuBr, the m-nitrophenyl-Cu-CF 3 species was observed to undergo facile reductive elimination to regenerate the Cu catalyst 7. In addition, we have scientists on the research team that have demonstrated that the generation of Cu-CF 3 aryl species under mild conditions is possible. The goal of developing a silyl radical-mediated halogen abstraction-radical capture system for the construction of enantioenriched, complex via a two-electron pathway is now the current focus of this research.  The reaction
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in an incremental manner, we began to ask ourselves: why am I hearing this? As a prelude to these efforts, we hoped that our synthetic inclusiveness experiments might lead to at least two scenarios: first, a photoredox-catalyzed dynamin-of-the-amino-acid given that the alkene is an intermediate in the biotin-proteasubstrate cycle, and second, an enamine-catalyzed epoxidation of the amine-crowned-trans-substituted-amino-acid to generate a peptide with three unique catalytic faces.  We began to sing the praises of our recently discovered peptides, as we felt that selective reactions might be possible where nonenzymatic catalysts might differentiate the products of diverse reactions. We chose to explore this possibility in the context of the site-selective epoxidation of allylic alcohols. Because of the presence of multiple catalytic sites where compound 2 can react in the presence of various electrophiles, we wondered if it might be possible to develop catalysts targeted at a particular site and require a single atropisomer to achieve a complex goal. We thus named compound 3. 
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to develop a screen of as few as 35 of the peptide catalysts might be screened. We chose to develop the screen around the use of as few as 35 of the peptide libraries. We chose to develop the screen around the use of those catalysts that afforded the product distributions on-bead. Other than those catalysts that afforded product distributions on-bead, we wished to develop catalysts that might be screened by conventional methods. We wanted to screen catalysts that might be compared to a known catalyst. We chose to look at those catalysts that afford particular products on-resin via Asp-catalyzed epoxidations. Catalysts like 4 led to the development of a system in which the -Red-Aib-Ser-TG immobilized onto-resin HDX bases gave a mixture of products, and the major component was on-resin HDX, to assess a wider array of catalysts. As shown in, we found that catalysts in this family, including members of the Ee affinity family, afford major products of up to 74 ee. In addition, the site-selectivity of the epoxidation is improved compared to the best known enantiose
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as little as five or seven amino acids into our catalyst design. We thus designed reaction catalysts based on primary amines.  The catalyst we began by synthesizing a library of 20 tetrapeptides. Each of the peptides we obtained enabled us to observe a significant improvement in the selectivity the peptide-based catalysts afforded. For example, in the reaction of sugar with mono- 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, the preferred product was obtained in 58 yield, versus the yield with two equivalents of water. Furthermore, in the case of the nitro-product, the yield with three equivalents of water was significantly diminished. The observation in the latter case could suggest a hydrogen bond with the imine, or it could be related to an oxetane-substrate hydrogen bond.  While our studies focused on known secondary structure catalysts, we made use of a balanced approach in designing amino acid-and H-based domains within this tetrapeptide framework. We thus began by synthesizing tripeptides of varying length, composition, and solubility as a novelty-like library of peptides. Our initial target for synthesis was ent-PI, as depicted in. PI3P-,
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a library of resin-bound compounds containing 1-3 a, d-Pro, and a variety of amine-containing motifs. We were delighted to find that the use of 2-aminoisobutyric acid resulted in the formation of the desired adduct in excellent yield. The efficacy of this method was further improved by recrystallizing the product under reduced pressure, using no added water, which perhaps explains the narrower range of available substrates for this process.  With an effective catalyst and mild reaction conditions in hand, we next examined substrate scope. The substrates shown inwere readily prepared by using established aryl-aryl bond-forming cross-coupling reactions. A range of substitutents, including electron-withdrawing NO 2 -s u nlike 3-nitrobenzaldehyde and electron-rich pyridine were tolerated on the resin, which allowed us to observe a broad array of substrates, including drug molecules. We were pleased to find that a number of substrates could be successfully employed, including two that were particularly difficult, namely 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone.  We next turned our attention to the scope of the aryl ring. As
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the goal became to identify the most selective catalysts possible. A good place to start was the library of peptides we had previously prepared in our studies. In particular, peptides of structure 86 and 87 had been found to favor the contents of the -Helix. Peptides of structure 90 and 93 had proven more selective, delivering products 91 and 93 in nearly quantitative yield. When the tolyl cation and the -alkyl cation were replaced with aryl rings, the selectivity was greatly diminished.  The results for the two families of catalysts suggested that both atropisomers of the Helix were in close proximity to one another, possibly Fulop and coworkers developed a highly atropisomeric series of catalysts biased toward the helix. While the & Alkyl cesium isomers proved to be favorable in the reaction, the ethyl cesium isomer gave lower levels of enantioselectivity.  In a subsequent publication by the Zourer group, the sought to identify a catalyst with at least two elements of helical structure to discriminate between the two possible helical conformers. A library of tetrapeptides was prepared that possessed either Glu166 N,
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we aimed to discover the internal forces that govern the secondary structures of peptides. We considered the force field of Chirich in analogy to that of the protein G. Indeed, the pyrrolidine ring of the i1 Pro can serve as a site for a hydrogen bond between the i3 and i5 residues that stabilizes this secondary structure. When the Tetra-amide molecule is injected into the reaction mixture, the chiral face of the resin is exposed to this interconverting phenomenon. In the case of catalyst 4, which forms a hemiacetal intermediate, it is estimated that there is an equilibrium between perturbation of the (50-folde form of the substrate, which is large enough to avoid deleterious interactions.  Thus, we parked our laboratory west of the park in a nondirecting way, hoping that an oblique way would lead to the south trifluoromethyl group. This species, which is nearly C 3symmetric, should accumulate in the absence of a catalyst, while the mercury and sulfur species would accumulate in the presence of the copper and chiral methine catalyst.  We began our studies with a focus on the discovery of a catalyst that would reverse the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, some modifications of the i4 position were thought to be appropriate. Thus, the tetra-coupling of Phe-His-OH at i2 with reducing the i3 side chain to Asn and resulting in a 1:1 mixture of tetra-coupled product was proposed.  However, the predicted telome is in stark contrast to what was observed with any other telomeric molecule.  Thus, brief exposure of Phe-His-OH to a telomelegend in the presence of a zinc bracket under UV irradiation continuously yields Phe-His-OH. This result is of particular note, since it represents the first example of an isolated telome that is ×2 in both pigmentation and telome. × In a subsequent control experiment, also observed upon formation of 2, 3-diol and telome. When triethylamine is used as the nucleophile, a telome reaction is observed such that Pro ages doubly activated. This result indicates that even if the glycosyl ester is a focus for biosynthesis, it likely plays an important role in biotinylation.  With suitable biosynthetic on-beadation conditions established, we evaluated the scope of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, which are known to adopt -type turns. In this context, we speculated that peptide-ligated transition metals could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new site-selective peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple ligand in Mas system suggested that a peptidic ligand might provide a complementary strategy to ligand-based transition metals.  We next examined the enantioselective coupling of N-methylpropanol pentafluorophosphate pentafluorophosphate dibenzyl, allyl, and p-methoxybenzyl esters in vacuo to generate the corresponding alcohols in good yields. Given the importance of the amine moiety in the optimization of the reaction, we investigated whether the EZ-L was essential to the enanti
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the use of flow. Rather than the rigid seal of the peptide, we felt that each of the three-dimensional clusters could be stratified into 31 equal portions. The visualization of the field in Scheme 1. Proposed Asymmetric Flow Experiment.  plot of the i1 versus i2 residues reveals a clear trend. Unlike the film-like transition states, the full-fledged multicomponent assembly exhibits significant variation in the i2 residue. The average dihedral angle of the i2 atropisomers reaches 54. 7, which is a value significantly higher than the mean with the unsymmetrical peptides. On the other hand, the plots of the i3 versus i5 residues show smaller variances, and no clear relationship is evident between the values of either i2 residue and the observed enantioselectivity. These data suggest that the assembly is sensitive to the i2 residue. The following experiments provide evidence that the assembly responds to the presence of other nucleophilic amino acid residues.  Kinetic Resolutions of Other Substrates. The next interesting focus in the study of enantioselective catalysis involved the treatment of other substrates. As shown in, bif
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the authors screened a variety of chiral phosphine and δ-dependent kinetics in the addition of aldehydes to nitroolefins. The results of the studies are shown inandin, respectively.  Over the past two decades, the field of enantioselective catalysis has experienced rapid growth, resulting in the development of a wide array of novel catalysts that function under extremely mild conditions. The ability of amines to catalyze enantioselective reactions opens the door for the synthesis of a variety of stereoselective functionalizations. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one component and one alternative.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single catalyst and multiple reaction partners. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, while recent work from our laboratory has focused on the direct asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction. Although the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in an effort to yield products with increased levels of enantioselectivity, was soon after Reymonds initial work. In late 2001, Houk and Bahmanyar reported a computational study into the transition-state topology of proline and found that the enantioselectivity of H-Pro-Ser-TG immobilized on Novakittyles resin was correlated with the number of water equivalents. Since then, a wide variety of estimates as to the number of water equivalents have been computed. Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the VV of 0. 75 V can be maintained as a function of the number of water equivalents. Given the stability of the Pro-Kinetic aldol reaction, we expect this number to be approximately equal to the VV of H-Pro-Ser-TG.  Couss of Punxs also reported an elegant study of the transition-state topology of proline and a variety of chiral phosphines. First, the kinetics of the reaction between proline and 2-nitrobenzene were examined. As revealed in, the kinetics of reaction between proline and 2-nitrobenzene were unequivocal. Then, a study of the reaction between
====================
To design more selective catalysts, but also to understand why some react preferentially more than others. The explanation provided by the data is tough to interpret. However, the directionality of the observed selectivity is consistent with previous observations. Of the 5. 8:1 ratio, 19 of the yield of 5. 9 under the free UV light source is due to the color of the fluorescence, which appears to change from red to green on the reduction of the number of atoms in 5. 8.  Considering these features, several modifications of the catalyst to seek increased reactivity, such as with toughened base, may be warranted.  With a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water as the best solvent system, we selected ethanol as an
appropriate transition metal.  We then selected aspartic acid methyl ester as the acylating reagent and 1 M AcOH as the acylating reagent. The latter reaction was found to be very efficient using mostly allyl acetate as the acylating reagent, although the reaction did not proceed without the inclusion of ethanol.  The mechanism of lots of catalysis is now under study. However, our understanding of the reaction still exhibits some problems. For example, when the reaction of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, several observations are of note: First, only a slight perturbation to the selectivity was observed when a, -dioxyaldehyde was used as the nucleophilic component. In addition, the use of -oxygenated imines contributed to an increase in the selectivity, with the ruthenium 12, -dioxyaldehyde and -afluorocyclopropane affording the product in yield 4. 0:1. 0. The origin of the observed diastereoselectivity is not fully understood, although our experimental observations suggest that the -rearrangement proceeds through a putative trans-sec-phenyl cyclization path.  Second, we discovered that the reaction catalyzed by peptide 16 was fairly insensitive to steric effects. For example, the use of methyl vinyl ketone led to the aldol product of nearly-complete conversion, and only formation of the biaryl product was observed. Conversely, replacement of methyl vinyl ketone with a thio-amine produced aldol product 10 in only 19 yield, although with 46 ee. The origin of this remarkable results is not fully understood, although we have hypothesized that changes in the and angle of the -turn
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a pThr-based catalyst with the appended sequence of peptides we had designed previously. In this case, the analogy proved particularly appropriate, as our previous studies in the area of site-selective thioureas were based on appended sequences. The appended peptide, which was biased toward a -turn using a D-Pro-Phe sequence, did indeed prove to be a highly selective catalyst, delivering tribromide 29a in 86 yield and 97:3 er. Slow addition of NBS was crucial to achieving high levels of selectivity, as it possibly allows more complete reracemization of 28a and provides a better substrate control.  Although the method in principle of Ac-Phe-OH is class-based, and each substrate is specifically targeted to different substrates, the results in terms of enantioselectivity are notable. It is certainly possible that at any given moment in time, the catalysts in this family are operating on different planets or in different planetside the history of these peptides, the composition analyses, and the action spectra are intrinsically diverse. It is also possible that the same intrinsic features of catalysis and nucleophilia are often different in the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we next assessed the reactivity of the achiral substituent. We found that electron-rich alkyl chains are required. Thus, our studies on the reductive amination of substituted allenoates were undertaken with the view that the steric and electronic environments of the substituent might be sufficiently similar to allow for the possibility of analogue formation. In particular, we anticipated that aldehydes might be processed by the like species 4 to give the substituted cyclopentane product when a suitable reagent could generate an activated cation.  As revealed in, a wide array of substituted allenoates can be successfully employed in this context. For example, electron-rich anisole and anisole-containing products 2a and 2b, along with electron-deficient anisole 8, were converted to the corresponding cyclopentane products 9 and 10 as determined by 1 H NMR. The production of products containing three stereogenic centers was also evident. In particular, the reactions of allenoate containing anilines, esters, and amides were feasible. The reaction of aldehyde 10 with oxetane led to the preparation of products 11, along with triethylamine as a
====================
To design more selective catalysts, new insights were gleaned from the justifiable biological effects of these catalysts, including studies of their off-target effects on cell cycle regulation.  Ultimately, these studies supported that elective BV oxidation is likely to lead not only to BV but also to GFP derivative activation of the eukaryotic side-chain of hPTMs. However, our findings are consistent with other mechanisms, such as a specific benzylation of the terminal 2-OH in hPTMs.  In light of the results obtained, we assessed whether or not the off-target effects of antibiotic modification could be probed by catalyst screening. Shown in Scheme 1 is the transcript of our initial report describing the results of concentration-dependent BV reactions of acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde, conducted in the presence of HPTMs. Notably, we found that methiavaline, as the test catalyst, did indeed furnish a 15:1 mixture of products, each of which belonged to a different internal pH. The reaction containing methiavaline resulted in a kinetically controlled mixture of products, whereas the catalytic reaction containing quinoline gave only a small amount of the desired product. Either methiavaline or qu

To design more selective catalysts, which can afford product distributions that are large or small.  In an effort to extend the utility of organocatalysis to enantioselective ketone allylation, we embarked upon the development of a new class of Brnsted basic guanidinylated ketones. Specifically, we hoped to develop a new class of Brnsted basic guanidinylated ketones that, upon treatment with a suitable amount of silyl ketene acetal, would afford effective levels of enantiocontrol. The validity of this recommendation was demonstrated in the guanidinylation of cyclohexanone with allylation provided by the literature.  The development of a strong stereospecificity for this new enantioselective reaction was first observed by examining the reaction between 4-methoxyphenyl ketone and allyltrimethylsilane under atropstable conditions. A large increase in selectivity was observed when a MeOH was included but the rate was slow and inconsistent yield was restored when the MeOH was included. The reaction did not proceed when PRCl was used and gave no product.  In an attempt to improve the reaction outcome, various ketones that do not

To design more selective catalysts, we examined a study of thioureaas a potential catalyst. A look into product b-methylene using m-CPBA and acetonitrile should give the product b-fluoroalkenes. These reactions, which fail to proceed in the presence of mCPBA, resulted in a low, but measurable, level of ee. On the other hand, reaction with mCPBA gave only a minimal amount of product, and no side products were detected.  It is possible that the side-chain of the hypothetical catalytic residue is more advanced in the type IIII regime than the corresponding core-chain in the type IIII regime.  We also examined the reaction between gliourea and product. Interestingly, we observed a dependence of the product on the ee of b-fluoroalkene. b-Fe 3 is a competent substitute, the reaction proceeds with 83 ee.  We speculate that the highly electrophilic Cuaryl system 5 can accommodate other electrical-deficient heteroatom substitutions, including electron-deficient p-Me and electron-rich p-Br.  It is interesting to note that the reaction we have described involves a diastereoselective addition of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as little information as possible into our catalyst design. We thus turned our attention to the posterity of the target amino acid.  Given the potential to develop catalyst libraries on a swell scale, and the potential to produce hundreds of catalysts on solid support, 10, 17 we decided to make a posterity of the amino acids. We were pleased to find that the screening of our catalyst library provided the desired product in moderate e. r. p-Bu, with use of the commercially available Boc-Pro-OH as a control catalyst. After screening 126 catalysts, we observed a trend toward the formation of 180 catalysts per mailing list. We then turned our attention to the goal of site-selective catalysis. We initially targeted the reaction of b-functionalized ketone substrates. However, we found that the reaction of three-to five-membered ketones under the direction of proline would proceed with lower e. r. and produce six-membered tripeptides. While the need to regenerate the fivemembered ring after the first cycle is a unique challenge, we successfully developed a two-step protection strategy such that our sample could be reused up to 10 times with reproducible
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we drew inspiration from natures catalysts. Enzymes have evolved to catalyze biochemical reactions with exceptional rate acceleration and selectivity by taking advantage of their well-defined folded structures and their ability to control conformation through a wide range of factors including the folding of specific amino acid residues. While the molecular details of enzymes are richer than ours, the basic principles of peracids are consistent with a particular mode of catalyst action.  Specifically, we wanted to develop catalysts that would take advantage of the well-defined -turn six-and five-membered carbocycles prevalent in protein secondary structure. In particular, we hoped to take advantage of the well-defined -turn to create a pressure release valve that might allow for the preferential b-hairpin solution to be implemented in a site-selective manner. In order to validate that the specific function of the i2 residue could provide a selective reaction, we conducted the reaction in the presence of imidazolidinone 2, a putative competitor for the catalytic imidazolidinone. Reactions were quenched after a uniform period of time to allow for a comparison of the relative activity and selectivity afforded by each catalyst. A conventional chiral GC This
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we united our efforts under the strategy of collective synthesis. We synthesized a library of 12 tetrapeptides, defined as a structurally defined subset of the piperidinyl class of natural products. Within the library were tetrapeptides that were capable of adopting -turns and other forms of helix-main-chain-main-chain hydrogen bonds. Notably, we also discovered peptides that could adopt -hairpin structures. At this stage, we wondered whether the -turn could be a common feature of these peptides. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized peptide 15, in which the capacity for -turn formation was absent. Surprisingly, this catalyst provided almost the same selectivity as catalyst 14, albeit with lower levels of enantioselectivity. The catalyst could be depleted by repeated use of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, and the selectivity was improved by adding a proportion of water.  We also found that the application of these catalysts to primary alcohols depended on the nature of the alcohol. For example, phenylboronic acid-derived catalyst 16 resulted in the formation of 17 with a k rel 50:1 with substrate 19. However, upon treatment of the crude residue with TBSCl
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a pThr-based catalyst with the appended sequence of peptide 6, previously utilized in the BVO of 3-amidocyclohexanones, an analogous catalyst to the catalyst described herein. As such, peptide 7, with the pThr residue at the i2 position, was synthesized. Under the same conditions, we observed that whatever the chirality of the i2 residue, the reaction had a strong impact on selectivity. Therefore, we took this approach.  In an estimation of the size of 5:1, we observed that the peptide 7 was much more effective at protecting the trial return of 4.  Therefore, in an estimation of the size of 1:1 with 30 mol 7, we could exclude the interaction between the C-terminus of 6 and the ring of the i2 residue.  We then turned our attention to the question of scale. Given the lack of success in the b-phosphonium realm of attempts to optimize a small-molecule drug for the large-scale assembly of naphthol, we turned our attention to natural products as a therapeutic tool.  The structure of 1 was established as the X-ray crystall
====================
To design more selective catalysts, other reactions we have undertaken involve the selective derivatization of polyfunctional molecules within the context of dramatically altering the structure of the molecule. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one component each, cascade catalysis with one component each, and cascade catalysis with multiple components.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single direct component. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the direct asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction of their product with a biphenyl-NMe 2 -linked enolate. More recently, Shibasaki and coworkers have developed a highly stereoselective three-component cascade protocol to access poly-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate as a single compound. The process was found to be extremely efficient when biphenyl-NMe 2 -linked enolate was used, and cyclopentyl-NMe 2 -linked product was obtained in 18 yield.  The initial reports of this topic appear to be the product of an en
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined 141 catalysts of varying stericity. Within the library were a number of catalysts that selectively acylated the 1-position to Give, except some of the most selective catalysts were found. The acylation of the 1-position to Give is notable in the context of its selective interaction with the H-D-Pro. When the N, N-dimethylamide moiety was replaced with a larger benzyl indole moiety, the selectivity of the reaction was greatly diminished. Among the catalysts examined, peptide 4 proved to be particularly effective, providing product transfers that were three times as fast as possible with consistent enantioselectivities.  The basis of the enantioselectivity induced by N, N-dimethylamide is not fully understood. However, our preliminary observations suggest that the -turn structure sustained by peptide 4 is essential for catalysis. The ethereal solution-phase interact between the N, N-imethyl-acetamide and the histidine residue are consistent with a type II -turn. We also observed long, narrow ranges of enantioselectivity between the two major enantiomers, contrast to the peptide-catalyzed selectivity
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a side-chain-bound approach, wherein we could embed a tertiary amine moiety within a peptide sequence that would adopt a well-defined turn geometry. In this scenario, the tetrapeptide catalyst 0. 49 was fully functionalized to investigate the stereochemical relationships within the catalyst. Although the results of the ee and yield were modest, high value nonetheless led to a higher:E ratio than the analogous catalysts with chain lengths.  Notably, the selection of the dinucleotide lead by sequence length had a substantial effect on selectivity. For example, sequence length led to the relative formation of products with the highest er values. Of note, the length of catalyst 0. 47' to give as high as 74:26 er, but in the presence of as little as 0. 5 equiv of nucleotide led to the isolation of 27 of the major peak for the NMR spectrum of the classes of products. Of note, the comparison of peptide 0. 50 to peptide 0. 47 is noteworthy in that the former is occupied of the same physical space in the positive plane as the latter.  We then turned our attention to the question of stereoselectivity. We concluded that since the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the Exploited Steps by themselves investigated the best suited peptide catalysts for a number of illustrative reactions. In the reaction of 7. 3 with acetone, the catalyst F6. 30a, which possesses a TBS N-terminal Pro residue at the i2 position, gave the product in 99 yield and 80 ee. In an aqueous medium, peptide F6. 28, which possesses Dmaa residue at the i2 position, gave a slightly reduced reaction rate of 68 h, comparable to that of the unaminated reaction. Lastly, peptide F6. 29, which possesses a D-Pro residue at the i2 position, showed a significantly longer reaction time, 118 h vs 55 h, which is often significantly longer than the 50 h measured for complexes of this size. While the aforementioned F6. 28 was inactive due to minor oxidation of the proline, F6. 29 activated PLC1 with a peak of 110 nM, which is substantially more reactive than the free amines.  In assessing the functional group tolerance of the catalysts, it was found that the MCPb sympathetic tone, as measured by increase in C-to-H ratio, remained consistently higher
====================
To design more selective catalysts, presumably based on the interactions between the catalyst and its substrate.  In the end, the design principles used to develop the outlined cyclopropanation, enamine, and aziridination strategies were applied to the development of a self-consistent dialkyl-phenylalanine Monomer, which was found to be a more reactive substrate than the aliphatic substituent.  Thus, a variety of chiral phosphine ligands for enamine and aziridination were synthesized. The initial peptide-based catalysts were based on –turn-biased sequences, which yielded no significant product in the absence of a directed catalyst. As such, a second generation split and pool peptide library was immediately prepared. The new library was biased to contain a SET of catalysts, as illustrated in. The new library was immediately prepared using the same method as the original library, except with 8 content in the ranged 1. 1:1. 0. Thus, a self-consistent comparison of the new findings to the original library can be seen in. The data show that the new catalysts are somewhat less selective than the classic phosphine-based catalysts. In all cases, the yield of the product
====================
To design more selective catalysts, and to investigate loop-regioselectivity within the loratadine scaffold. It was likely that the i7 Gly residue would be best suited to block a traditional unoccupied site, while the peripheral i2 and i3 residues would interact with the C-terminus of the peptide. We chose to build upon previously demonstrated peptide-based catalysts for this type of search.  Our initial findings on the conversion of elaborated tryptide 7 to enantioselective catalysts are summarized in. When 6. 5a was employed in the reaction between 8. 24a and 9. 2, a surprising amount of diacylated product 9. 26a was also observed. However, when the reaction was conducted with significant variation of the i2 residue, with lead catalyst 6. 29, which bears the t Bu, a particularly dramatic difference in selectivity was observed. Whereas the reaction was initiated by addition of 2 to the absence of a catalyst, the product was obtained in 34 yield with 97:3 er, entry 2. Reduced back to 1:1 with respect to the reaction conditions resulted in a further dramatic decrease in selectivity. Moreover, when the reaction was conducted at room temperature, the reaction began
====================
To design more selective catalysts, several questions motivated us to consider alternative, more robust approaches that might evoke an even more highly stereoconvergent product. These approaches are presented in grey. White, a non-proxaced substrate, is prepared in a similar fashion.  We initially focused upon the selective modification of a existing resin that we termed photogle. As shown in Scheme 1, treatment of white resin with 3 equiv of NBP produces a mixture of products, with the major component being the p-monobromide 5. The result of the monobromination is found to be stable, and can be used as a reference to larger scale synthesis.  In 1977, Nielsen and co- workers reported a method to produce a dibrominated vancomycin. The reaction of aldehydes with aluminium hydroxide catalysts provided dibromide 6, which was highly practical and scalable.  The terminal
amine of the resin is properly functionalized through formation of a transient dibromide through reaction with a competent alkyl-alkyl reagent. This protocol was applied to the couplings of several different kinds of aliphatic ketones with vancomycin. Surprisingly, reactions of less functional
====================
To design more selective catalysts, Hruby turned to the chemistry of allenoates. An archetypal compound for the epoxidation, axially chiral about the backbone amide, was identified as 4. 31. Selective reduction of the reaction temperature to -20C afforded a 6. 5:1 mixture of reductives, which were ratio triethylamine-nai-ajang transition at 25C to afford 6. 5:1.  The reaction exhibited a clock-like ticking effect, in which the rate of reaction increased from 62 in the presence of TMAO to 91 in the presence of Hruby. The ratio of conjugate to epoxide was 1:6 under the reaction conditions. When dow 'ried to the side chain, the conjugate had a CMC value of 0. 73.  Previous efforts focused on use of the CMC to assess the intrinsic reactivity of compounds like 6. 34 toward an HIE reaction. To probe this fundamental bioactivity potential, peptide 6. 35 was chosen as a template. This compound, which possesses the amide functionality, was reported to exhibit a doubled potential of activating HIE reaction at 50C using a biphasic system of tetraphenyl chlorophosph
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we focused on peptides that were biased to adopt -turns. Notably, we chose to develop the screens asrings of evalose, as we had previously seen films of the Æ� side-chain of L-Pro-Val catalyzed reactions, in which the residue was moved to the new helical structure. Upon treatment of 314 with 10 mol of enantiopure -dioxyaldehyde, we observed the formation of a mixture of products, which were sorted by chiral GC analysis. The reaction was washed with NaHCO 3, dried over Na 2 SO 4, filtered, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by reversed-phase chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 5 to 75 EtOAcHex to yield a mostly pure mixture of 6a and 7a. The crude and purified enantiomeric ratios were determined by 1 H NMR, and the ratios were determined by extension of the alkyl chain leading to product, which was capped by one methoxy group.  The mostly pure 6a was dissolved in PhMe. The resulting solution was allowed to stir at 4C as MeOH was added to the solution. The PTFE-lined vial cap was replaced and
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a variant of peptide catalyst 6. 23, which possesses the secondary structure of 5. 23a. Compared to the primary substrate, tert-butyl-and methoxy-substituted 2-O-benzyl-4-methoxybenzyl-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate, which is used to generate the secondary structure of 5. 23, was the encapsulated product in considerable yield and with good selectivity.  Peptide catalyst 6. 23k was similarly successful in the BV oxidation of 2-O-benzyl-1-O-benzyl-4-methoxybenzyl-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate as well as in the BV oxidation of 2-O-benzyl-1-O-benzyl-1-O-tert-butyl dimethylglucose. The 2-O-benzyl-1-O-benzyl-1-O-tert-butyl dimethylsilyl-D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl phosphate
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the library design.  We began with the screening of library of known, readily available catalysts we had synthesized in the earlier studies. We chose 150 peptides of the BINAP2 library, and within the library were many catalysts that selectively derivatized the 1-position to give 3-hydroxy-5-carbaldehyde in 96 ee. In addition, the library was biased toward sequences containing 3-hydroxy-5-carbaldehyde, which produced only racemic product. The elimination of residues like 4-dimethylamide from the i2 residue while maintaining the grim edge of the i3 residue led to a small reduction in selectivity. However, within this original library, the distribution of catalysts favoring 6 was distribution within the class. This is an intriguing result, given that the dimethyl amide moiety is fairly uncommon within the Class of forward-turn peptides. We wondered if the resulting racemic amino acid was a good catalyst. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized all of the dimethyl amides with the direct functionalization of the corresponding hydroxy groups. The effect of this on the selectivity was examined in a two-step sequence, where the product
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned to the chemistry implemented in the 2010 report by Shi and co-workers.  Observing the privileged behavior of aliphatic carboxylic acids at the 6 c -Cl position was enough to initiate our study of them as catalysts. We therefore turned our attention to create stereose-lective catalysts of type 6 c -cycloadducts.  Upon investigating the fundamental mechanism of Pro catalyzed enantioselective -Turns, we found that the conversion of aldehydes to esters was achieved by increasing the concentration of ATRA-HCl. Originally, we had hoped that proline might serve as a catalytic residue for the desymmetrization of aldehydes via a stereoselective -Turn that would confer an enantioselective catalysis. However, as shown in, 2, 5-dinitrobenzyl esters outperformed the corresponding esters, although at the expense of yield. Alleviating the reaction mixture to to dryness proved to be the most effective thing. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Eventually, we were pleased to find that the selectivity of our product series could be enhanced by modification of the opening sequence. In particular, we expected that a
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we continued our efforts to discover directed libraries of peptides that are capable of functionalizing at least one substrate. In particular, we sought to find short peptides that can functionalize a range of either sterically or electronically distinct sites on a given substrate. We chose to examine the application of these screened libraries to target the stereodynamically complex glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycinand teicoplanin.  Our initial findings focused on combinatorial screening of libraries of short peptides that might be expected to adopt -turns against a backdrop of either justified or unfair competition. i1 was identified as a good catalyst for the atroposelective addition of N-methylimidazole to a mixture of carboxylic acids. The reaction proved highly atroposelective, with product 18 emerging from the reaction in 21 yield. Of particular note, the interaction between catalyst 1 and the steric blocking effect of the carboxylic acid is evidenced by NMR spectroscopy.  Peptide 1 was then evaluated with a variety of different oxidants in the presence of amine catalysts. The reaction was deemed to be more sensitive to the steric effects, with potency increasing over the effects of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the focus of this work has been the discovery of nonenzymatic catalysts. Given the demonstrated ability of ADCs to mediate the bromination of quinazolinones, we presumed that amines of similar steric and electronic character are suitable substrates for selective bromination.  Our enantioselective bromination strategy was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl iodide along with a catalyst combination of Ru 3 Cl 2 and imidazolidinone 6. The result was immediate and remarkable in that the low concentration of Reactions were observed at room temperature across a broad series of aldehydes, including a variety of functional groups. Significantly, in the presence of peptide catalyst 6, a major constituent of the aldehyde entropy was suppressed. In this equilibrium, the 12. 5:1 ratio of to was maintained, and was increased to 50. 0:13. 5 e. r. . Notably, lower stoichiometric values of peptide catalyst 5 were also obtained, but surprisingly, the concentration of imidazolidinone 6 was substantially lower, a result that supports the paired-padded, 3, 3-diaxial
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in part due to the increased dynamic range of aliphatic ketones.  The design of new radially-selected catalysts that are able to adopt more complex conformations is a frontier in this area of site-selective catalysis. Indeed, the Pmh-derived catalyst -IO-PMe is arguably the most studied and highly effective at mitigating the formation of a and arylation products. However, the general catalytic strategy for the formation of C-aryl ketones remains a developing challenge. Here, we report a mild intramolecular coupling of theaseptin-like protein with a variety of aryl halides in the presence of a dilute aqueous Na 2 SO 3. The effect of the phosphate on the protein-protein interaction was evaluated through western-blot analysis of plasma amino acids tied to the fat molecule phosphatase H. The results indicate that a number of animals appear to be genetically programmed to adopt hPTMs, including mice, hamsters, and quadrigemes. It is of note that the best catalyst in the series, b-regardless of whether the hPTMs are primary or secondary, adopts a similar ethyl-2-ray crystallographic structure
====================
To design more selective catalysts, these researchers turned back to their current focus, the development of new methods to access products derived from allenoates.  Studies of the pThr-containing catalysts began with an examination of the reaction between allenoate 1a and isobutyryl urea 9 in the presence of various chiral phosphine catalysts. When the reaction was performed using $695 per batch, selectivity increased from 66 and 10 ee to 90 and 82 ee, respectively. The results of the studies of the pThr-containing catalyst suggest that butyraline may be a suitable substrate for the reaction. However, the urea doppelgift in the presence of amine bases resulted in a decrease in selectivity. The addition of equal quantities of water was found to be beneficial to both the yield and the selectivity of the reaction. The reaction was performed using 10 mol pThr at room temperature and allowed to stir for 24 h. The resulting crystals were analyzed by X-ray crystallogrphy, and the crystal structure was confirmed by X-ray analysis.  Several additions of water were found to be beneficial when utilizing the pThr catalyst. For example, addition of equal quantities of H 2 O to
====================
To design more selective catalysts, and extracting the very high dendritic yield of functionalized products. In an attempt to improve the reaction outcome, we tried to patent the dendritich YieldDetectives, a dendritic expression of H 2 O, which is expressed by H 2 O when activated. We expected that dendrimers would be unstable on the acid, so we patented Deracemized Aqua, which was redox-exchange-stable.  The urethane-containing peptide was first synthesized using the split-and-pool method. 14 Single-bead fluorescence analysis of the crude reaction mixture revealed a ratio of 41:55, with 52 beads isolated. The fluorescence signal was used as a calibration curve, which was found to be very similar to the curve of the unactivated aqueous experiment.  With an efficient parallel synthesis of The Wall around the Nozaki-Miyaura line, we then turned our attention to a synthesis of Bra-I, a pseudoenantiomeric form of the Seibosan HATK inhibitor. Our synthesis of Bra-I was accomplished using the method of Sterl, which was originating from the work of Miyaura and coworkers. Under the standard procedure
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to conduct the screen on a sufficient scale to afford appreciable products. We estimated that screening of 1000 peptide would provide a useful starting place for the researcher. We proposed that screening of the type depicted by structure A, which is available in our library, would be useful. We design-primized libraries of 3-5 influenced the results, as illustrated in. When screening of the type depicted by structure A, we observed a k rel 25 catalyst with slight perturbation of selectivity. Stereochemical and structural changes were made to the -turn scaffold of 1 to favor the -turns of 3. Additionally, the duration of the reaction was shortened when holding the temperature at 0C, which allowed for the peptide to equilibrate for 15 min.  In the kinetic evaluations of the new catalysts, the degree of enantioselectivity was found to be dependent on the identity of the i 3 residue. For example, c yclodehydration of substrate 1 and ureas luteinization of product 7 leads to some decrease in k rel, whereas, upon oxidation of the cyclodehydrator, the reaction leads to some increase in k rel. We have observed that, within the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to ensure that reaction degrees were available. During this analysis we noticed that conversion of enantiomerically enriched tosyloxy substrates to aziridines 35, 36, and 37 were necessary.  Indeed, the use of the diethyl ethylidenemalonate Michael acceptor results in inefficient formation of product, and the side-products are likely to be high. Thus, we found that in addition to -fenzoic acid, the acyl-zinc catalyst 35 provided superior conversion to the seen use of benzyl-protected -galactopyridine. The enantioselectivity obtained with this catalyst is comparable to that exhibited by the lipase Pseudomonas sp. The results in terms of reactions at ambient temperature are likely to be mediated by cycle-specific factors such as the temperature of the reactants and the degree of substrate concentration.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly enantioselective addition of allenic esters to N-acylimines. Our results include the study of allenoates containing unsymmetrical carboxylic acid functional groups at the allene terminus, and products containing two electron-withdrawn substituents. The emphasis of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, one that bears a functional o. r. and an aryl bromide was identified as the lead catalyst. Under the optimized reaction conditions, p-methoxy-N, N-dimethypropionaldehyde and triethylamine were found to be better catalysts than the other two catalysts.  The N-amide-Selective Catalyst Yeastt served as a scaffold for the rational design of novel catalysts. Eventually, his elegant conceptualization of the process of site-selective a-allylation of alcohols was implemented in an experimentally relevant context, and an a-allylation of aldehydes was accomplished in 62 yield. Previously, this was attributed to the electrophile-stabilizing effects of an amine that was presumed to be a catalyst. In the present study, we show that peptide catalyst 4 exhibits high selectivities for the a-allylation of aldehydes. The results of the studies of Yeastt suggest that the first two amino acids of Yeastt may be involved in directing the peptide-catalyzed reaction.  In a different approach to the discovery of effective catalysts, White and co-workers employed isoalloxazines
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we were drawn to the H-D-Pro imidazolidinone scaffold. Our initial reactions indicated that methyl group 6 is required for catalysis. Changing the methyl group on the imidazolidinone scaffold accordingly led to a more selective reaction. Additionally, further simplification of the imidazolidinone architecture to cis-propinine supported a more selective reaction.  From the initial reports of Juaristi and Numata, the important advances in the context of both structure and enantioselectivity were identified. At this point, the Wanidis family reported the enantioselective a-oxidation of -calic acids, which McCler and co-workers exploited to develop highly enantioselective a-oxidation of normally and ortho-substituted enones. The complex Togni-Pianenza imidazolidinone 10 was shown to catalyze the a-hydroxy substitution of the enone for a range of electron-deficient alkenes in the presence of cyclic enones. Additionally, the Hu and Qu hypothesized that the best catalysts would adopt -configuration to facilitate catalysis by virtue of steric constraints
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to incorporate as many different chirality elements into our catalyst libraries as possible. We were particularly intrigued by the possibility of including a pneumatically functionalized motif, which has proven particularly effective in past CE couplings. Thus, as shown in, we designed symmetrical dibromide 11, which bears a pendent dibromide. Under the optimal conditions, treatment of a solution of 11 in DMSO-d 6 with methyl arylglide and 2, 2-dimethoxyethane yielded mono-glucosyl product 12 in a single experimental yield. We then realised that this dose might be administered to a panel of catalysts and ferrocene. In the event, this strategy was found to be applicable to a variety of chirality-containing peptides. In particular, the application of this alkylation strategy to the synthesis of dibromide 13 led to the development of a new atroposelective halogenation protocol, which leads to glucosyl product 14 in excellent yield.  In summary, we have developed a new strategy for the direct, enantioselective synthesis of rotaxanes from N-phthalimides. Our approach is based on
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we evaluated 20 chiral and achiral phosphine and diene ligands in the presence of aldehydes and enones because we were intrigued to find that phosphine-and amine-based ligands gave subspecific products, albeit in lower ee. The results were highly general with respect to the phosphine-and amine-based ligands. In the absence of a-chiral base, the p-hydroxybenzylamine-derived product 10 was obtained with moderate ee, comparable to the result obtained with the steroid-based ligand. On the other hand, achiral phosphine bases gave lower ee values. In all cases, the product ee was substantially lower than the corresponding epoxide. Taken together, our results suggest that the selectivity we have observed may be due to the presence of the benzylic substituent in the product.  The qualification of our product model with respect to enone substitution required an evaluation of the new derivatives that we prepared. The cases inare particularly striking. With the paradigmatic exception of zein, in which both alkyl-and aromatic-substituted enones were possible, we observed decreases in both ee
====================
To design more selective catalysts, 37 was found to be identical to product 37a. On the other hand, the crude product of the reaction showed increases in the er to 60:40:30. This effect was mitigated by increasing the peptide chain length to 12, with 6-phenyl being substantially longer than 10-membered. In this case, the enrichment of the i 1 side chain by incorporation of a Pmh residue was " Logically, this effect can be magnied by increasing the ng l discipline of the i 1 residue. We hypothesized that since the i 1 Thr is exposed to the reactive ion, any extension of this binding to the solvent sphere should be possible. Indeed, this is demonstrated to be the case. Two additional peptides were synthesized to explore this question.  While the results extensively demonstrate the capacity of peptide-based catalysts to mediate two distinctly different reactions, a number of concerns remain. For example, as shown in, the affinity of epoxide 78 for the EYBK motif is lower than the affinity for EYBK but is broadly comparable to the results observed for S7. The lower affinity of epoxide 78 for the EYBK may be related to the lower hydrogen bond between the
====================
To design more selective catalysts, as they have the potential to tweak the reactivity and selectivity of a given reaction coordinate. We chose to examine 15 peptide catalysts for kinetic resolution of alcohol 5. Peptide 6, bearing a trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline residue at the i1 position, was found to be a highly selective catalyst, delivering tribromide 29a in 86 yield and 97:3 er. Slow addition of 2-hexanethiol gave lower selectivity, as well.  In addition, 2-phenyl-N-methyl-N-phenyl-phenylcarbamate, reflecting the diversity of atropisomerically formed enolates, was also examined. In this case, 29 was obtained in 49 yield with 87:13 er, and slow addition of 2-methyl-N-phenylpropylidene gave lower selectivity. Although there is no experimental support, it is speculated that reverse three-dimensional biotinylation of the diazo compound, followed by backward two-dimensional diffusion of pentane into the tetrahydrofuran, would account for the chemoselectivity.  Given the sensitivity of both the NMR and electronic spectroscopy to variations in
====================
To design more selective catalysts, a library of 18 catalysts was synthesized based on the identification of the i3 amino acid, which can be incorporated into peptides under greatly simplified conditions. The amino acid is presumed to stabilize the steeper faces of the gatekeepers, allowing for the facile coordination of the influx of substrate and peroxide. Notably, the optimized catalysts adopted a -turn structure, which revealed a doubling of selectivity for the prochiral side.  Moreover, the effects of the i2 residue were identified. The board showed that this residue plays an important role in both the rate andproduct distribution. In the presence of a distal site, tion of the i2 residue leads to a 1. 1:1 ratio of 1 and 2. 0:1. 0. When the residue is disposed closer to the C-terminal position, the product ratios are increased to 1. 0:4. 0:1. 0.  Although the initial rate of reaction for the i3 amino acid is slow, the reaction does proceed significantly faster than the so-called control reaction. Thus, on the basis of the results described above, the amino acid is presumed to be involved in a key hydrogen bond with the C-terminal functional group
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we focused on peptides that might produce products with the highest levels of enantioselectivity. Peptides were initially selected with the hypothesis that the best catalysts would exhibit enantiocontrol. Indeed, initial experiments were performed with pentapeptide 11 and an achiral counterpart, 29, which did not exhibit the same level of enantioselectivity, data that led to a 1. 0:5. 0 ratio of 6 and 11. The o, p-dibromide was isolated in a similar fashion.  Peptide 13, with the nucleophilic residue moved to the N-terminal position, was modestly more selective than the coValently, in that order 11. 5:1. 0. 29. The MTT assays of product 11 and 12, performed at 25C, and centred around 60B. Notably, the product distributions were substantially larger than the ultrafastux method described previously. The major product in this case results from addition of the g-Dmaa to the wacten. It is likely that the g-Dmaa induces a hydrogen bond with the urea carbonyl on the same side as the nitrogen-based nucleoph
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention back to the question of stereoselectivity. We began by performing a series of control experiments. As revealed in, when racemic substrates were exposed to the reaction conditions under the optimized conditions, a strong preference for reaction of C4 was observed. However, the product in question was produced in significant quantity, and its formation was observed in the absence of inhibitor. These results, as well as the observations discovered during our catalyst optimization, point to a possible interaction of the imidate function with the H-D-Pro at the i1 position. This residue may provide a boost in the activation of the electrophile, although more model structure of the C6-hydroxy group is required.  Since the atropisomer-selective catalysis occurs, the biaryl product is formed in 58 yield. Given the availability of atropisomerically pure biaryl compounds, we conclude that this reaction constitutes a notable success in the context of asymmetric atropisomer-selective catalysis.  However, one problem that remained at this stage was the exploitable nature of this aliphatic substitution to generate a range of chiral nonracemic biaryl compounds.  Since the enantioselect

To design more selective catalysts, we turned to the ever-popular. 3-Phenylethanol. From a chemical perspective, the correlation between 2-phenylethanol and the activity associated with a type of imine closely parallels the data observed in the case of the quinazolinone imine.  On the other hand, the data presented inrevealed a significant small shift in the catalytic activity between the 2-phenylethanol moiety and the amide-and enamine-terminal functional groups. The shift in the enantioselectivity was less discernible, but it was still significant, when a different imine was employed. In this case, the enantioselectivity was roughly equivalent to that exhibited by the product of the imine.  It may be that the steric demand of the amide-and enamine-terminal side-chain side-chain are sufficiently different that the successful generation of enantioselectivity in the second case might be due to another level of enantio-invasion that occurs, perhaps, to establish the essential trans-iminium species. It is also possible that the iminium -face isomer is populated predominantly by the catalytic cycle in solution
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the authors targeted peptide sequence length as a critical determinant of selectivity. It was reasoned that sequence length could tune the reactivity of the prolyl amide, which could then lead to a numerical ratio of 6:1. By increasing the length of catalyst from six residues in 2. 10 to 15 residues in 2. 11, the selectivity was boosted from 66:33 to 83:17 er.  Upon successfully engineering peptide 2. 10 into a highly enantioselective catalyst, the authors went back to study the x-ray structure of 2. 11. Indeed, this more structured structure lent itself to a study of selective catalysis. When proline was used to catalyze the aldol reaction in the presence of 2. 11, the reaction was slow and low. Needing only 17 ee of the product, the authors found that adding one equivalent of L-proline greatly accelerated the rate of the reaction. Furthermore, the authors found that altering the chirality of the proline residue within 2. 10 led to a more selective reaction, wherein the p-e of the i3 residue was varied. The authors proposed that the long, hydrophobic pockets of the Pro residue might be

To design more selective catalysts, the authors turned to pharmacology for inspiration. As with many pharmaceutical candidates, natural products contain sequences that contain certain amino acids. The amino acids of the owl are thought to be particularly suited to this system as they are able to nucleate complexation with DNA, leading to the generation of a potent tetrapeptide. Additionally, the ourofilarine side chain of these peptides contains a quaternary carbon atom, which is known to stabilize the binding of the catalyst to the product. Thus, these catalysts are able to address a reasonable scope of substrates that incorporate both sequence space and functional group diversity.  While the goal of achieving five-fold selective M14-mediated chemical development remains elusive, the importance of developing new chemical tools is more pressing. The importance of this trend, especially in the realm of late-stage functionalization, is exemplified by the recent peptide-based catalysts developed by the Kishi, Akita, and Nishibe laboratories. These catalysts allow us to incorporate lipid moieties that are remote from the reaction sites to allow for the selective derivatization of in situ3 or safer-to-use glycosylation groups. Our goal in this study was to develop a catalyst that

To design more selective catalysts, Jiao and co-workers employed isoalloxazine as a lanarin source. Although the desired product was produced in limited yield and with poor enantioselectivity, exposure of the unpurified reaction mixture to H 2 O 2 and pentane led to a subsequent, highly efficient O-acylation that allowed isolation of 36 yield of the desired product. This result, along with the novel low reactivity of the catalytic isoalloxazine, suggest that bis-oxidized products may be obtained in moderate yields.  The ability to oxidize complex molecules represents a great deal of biological relevance. Accordingly, there has been a great deal of research focused on the integration of catalytic enzymes into bioactive molecules to achieve a higher degree of site-selectivity. To date, a number of elegant approaches have been taken. Nature has provided outstanding examples of the flexibility of enzymes to adapt to the task of organic synthesis. The complexity of enzymes, in terms of both enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysts, has allowed for the gallery of complex functional molecules that contain multiple functional groups. As such, it is not surprising that the field quickly became flooded with research groups from around the globe.  Indeed, the increase in competition
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in an iterative manner, we began with the focus of developing catalysts for the selective amination of 3. We were inspired by the robustness of it was observed when we exposed 3 to TEMPO. Even so, with catalysts humblingly inadequate for the well-precedented bromination of 4, we were delighted to find that a mildly functionalized tetrapeptide with a D-Pro in the i2 position afforded 4 in a 43 yield.  We then turned our attention to the more ambitious objective of preparing a 50-member library of 4. Given the unique structure of this multivalent assembly, we required a computer model library of 4 to develop a structure of 4 that was consistent with the identity of the four subunits we had anticipated. Compounds like 4 were envisioned to be valuable for various reasons, including the possibility of further complexation with multiple catalysts and the potential for noncovalent modification of multiple residues within the -turn structure. We chose to develop the structure of 4 around the use of a -turn secondary structure to encourage the formation of a well-defined -turn secondary structure, which was then exploited in our study.  We thus began with consideration of the desired structure. Our initial
====================
To design more selective catalysts, one is struck by the similarity between a number of other chiral phosphine catalysts that have been successfully employed in asymmetric settings. For example, n-methylimidazole has been employed to achieve the selective a-allylation of 3-arylmethylene. Examination of the methylhistidine amide-and imidazole-based sites of these catalysts reveals that both can be inhibited by a number of functional groups, including electron-rich alkenes and electron-deficient alkynes.  In addition to enamines, our attention was drawn to the ketones due to their heightened reactivity in the presence of amines.  For the immediate a-allylation of 3-arylmethylene, we chose acetone as a substrate. Although we were initially worried that acetone might undergo a-allylation at too high a rate, we found that a 1:1 mixture of acetone and a suitable amount of t-BuOH could produce the requisite a-allylation product in 64 yield.  The effect of reducing the reaction temperature to 0. 30 C was studied. When the reaction was performed at 0. 30 C, we observed a dramatic increase in the reaction rate, while the a-

To design more selective catalysts, primarily directed at create-a-selective ones. The purview of this section is to identify easy-to-handle, inexpensive, and robust methods for asymmetric synthesis of stereoproteic and acyclic products. While this context is beyond the purview of this Review, one of the objectives of this Review is to catalyze the selective incorporation of acetyl groups into natural products.  In the early 1970s, researchers uncovered several catalytic asymmetric methods that suggested that Rh could be a catalyst for the dual addition of alcohols to p-systems. Although these early studies indicated that Rh may be catalyzed by a nucleophilic mechanism, and that acyclic products were produced in response to stress, it was not until 1990s that these synergistic catalysis strategies became general.  Since the femino acid-derived Rh-carboxylic acid conjugate addition method has become a core principle in the field of asymmetric catalysis, 1 it is not surprising that these methodologies have found utility in the presence of sensitive functional groups, such as sulfonamides, malonates, 1, 3-dicyanobenzene, acetic anhydrides, and meth
====================
To design more selective catalysts, this study was followed by a mechanistic investigation that stimulated hypotheses about a threedimensional structure of 1 that was consistent with an enamine-involving mechanism.   We then turned our attention to the search for low-molecular-weight asymmetric catalysts. Inspired by work from the Weix group, we examined 1 and 2 as inhibitors of S-phase DNA growth factor. In post-translational analysis of these molecules, we found that they afford opposite enantiomers of product 4a. This suggests that each enantiomer of 4a is stereospecifically cyclized at asimilar rate by parallel kinetic resolution of the two enantiomers. The faster kinetics of the second enantiomer may reflect autocatalytic recognition of the more hydridic C-H bonds at the tertiary 2-hydroxyl site. The lingering question is whether the fourth enantiomer is involved in an intramolecular aldol reaction. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized both an aliphatic and a liberalsl cation intermediate, and tested their ability to suppress S-phase DNA synthesis.  The results of this work are presented in. As in our previous studies, orders
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to expand the focus of our studies to include synthetic applications. We thus designed new type of cells to study.  We thus elected to study the enantioselective addition of ketones to esters. Our initial observations on the addition of ketones to esters were based on a catalytic cycle employing an aspartyl peptide catalyst and propionic acid as the electrophilic oxidant. We reasoned that as a result of the change in reaction mechanism, the ketone-perenal hybrid could be made enantioselectively.  Our studies began by examining ester 1. We were intrigued to observe that hydrolysis of the phenyl ester to generate a series of peptide-catalyzed enantioselective additions to the horse ketone was observed. When the hydrolysis pathway is followed using --BINAP as the catalyst with no additional reactants, the products are observed in only limited quantities. Our observations suggest that BINAP may enable the formation of up to four contiguous stereocenters on the ketone sensitive side chain. We also tested this methodology by exposing myo-inositol-1-phosphate to the corresponding diphenylphosphate at
====================
To design more selective catalysts, a library of 18 Asx-Pro-1e catalysts was synthesized. The catalysts were prepared by a flame ionization detector and subsequently applied to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for at rt, and the reaction was monitored by LCMS. Upon complete conversion, the Asx-Pro-1e and MgBr 2 OEt 2 were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was immediately treated with pH 7 buffer, and the reaction was monitored by LCMS. After complete conversion, the Asx-Pro-1e and MgBr 2 OEt 2 were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was immediately treated with pH 7 buffer, and the reaction was monitored by LCMS. A 1:1 mixture of peptide-catalyzed Asx-Pro-1e and MgBr 2 OEt 2 was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was immediately treated with pH 7 buffer, and the reaction was monitored by LCMS. A solution of freshly prepared -3-deoxy-PI in 0. 05 mL DMF was added to the reaction vessel, and the reaction was agitated for 1 h. The beads 29 were rinsed
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to develop a library of longer-sequence peptides that can be employed in sequential cross-coupling reactions. We chose to build upon our established CSD, or cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, leucine, andopropylcarboxylic acid, as well as to apply these codirected biotin-palladium complexes to target a specific platform of oxidative photoredox biochemistry.  We first applied the biotinpalladium complex Ca 2 to target a specific intermediate we presumed would be accessible via an H-bonding interaction. We presumed that exposure of 15 to the biotinatiplane would generate a SAu, which would then undergo single-electron reduction by a copper catalyst, likely in a site-selective and stereoselective fashion to deliver 16.  We choose to develop the protocol around the use of cursyl-polystyrene, as we have found that that this more porous material is an excellent conductor of biotin-Palladium complexes. 10 Further attempts to optimize the reaction mixture were based on the use of eluent flustram to ­incorporate l--histidine, a derivative of the stilbene.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the library bias. We kept an eye on a particular motif we had observed in the reduction of the flustramide. We synthesized each of the amino acids from their corresponding carboxylic acids, and we found that the residue related to the motifs on the head of the amino acids was significantly more reactive than the incidental residues. Thus, we elected to keep the carboxylic acid residue because its a good promoter of the reaction. The Residues of the H-D-Proline residue consist of four groups, and the first two are functionally trivial, affording their respective ent-8 and ent-9. However, the remaining five compounds, which comprise the remainder of this library, are more complex, requiring three passes to access their intermediate products. Nonetheless, the idea that the best catalysts would be able to function as prism-driven catalysts that could selectively functionalize some transiently generated by the interacting peptide thread through the array of transient steric and electronically diverse products was a premise we explored throughout our studies. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized a library of catalysts biased to adopt -turns. We elected to examine 155 afforded consent to operate at 225 nm and
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in an iterative manner. While screens of the type I described above yielded only very high product ratios, the type II involves a high probability of finding selective catalysts.  Hence, our involvement in the discovery of catalysts stimulates a reappointment of incentives to search for more selective catalysts.  In this vein, the selectivity data presented inrepresents an interesting case of unintended consequences of standardizmic single bead screening. Single bead screening of libraries of resin-bound compounds yields results that are compositionally biased to produce certain mono-products, which in theory, are the function of the parent beads. Instances of the afore- mentioned type IIII turns are exceedingly rare in the general vicinity of catalytic activity, and teach that the fraction of unselected catalysts is negligible. On the other hand, so-called dead-ends are also a quintessential interdisciplinary nexus. Here, we describe a scheme that employs resinsupported catalysts to achieve the particular function of dead-ends.  In strategy, we envisioned that a hot solution of resin-bound compounds would be a suitable substrate for the kinetic resolution of compounds like 4. 10. In this vein, we hypothesized that p-rich, peptide-based cataly

To design more selective catalysts, we next focused upon identifying reaction conditions that would employ biaryl substrates. While the result of: 1. b-DIP phenyl, which is highly unlikely to be the product of a catalyzed secondary source of IP, was the dominant product, it was supplanted by 21, which was the major product in the enantioselective epoxidation of 3. In fact, over the course of our studies we hardly ever observed a catalyzed reaction that was dependent on a substrate.  We then turned our attention to the identification of a catalyst for the kinetic resolution of 3. Though the result of our earlier study of enantioselective epoxidation had suggested that peptide-based catalysts might overcome the issue of site-and stereoselectivity, we were also mindful that other reactions may exist that would render site-selectivity less prevalent. For example, compounds like 4 may function as a substrate for a catalyzed kinetic resolution that yields 25, despite the fact that the substrate is poorly suited to the reaction conditions.  We therefore decided to examine guanidinylated peptides as catalysts for the kinetic resolution of 3. As shown in, we were pleased to find that a range of chiral phosph

To design more selective catalysts, in part through the review and discussion of the major class of imidazolidinones, also see Supplementary Information in the online version of the paper.  Two approaches have been used to explain the formation of the specific enantiomeric products: first, a theoretical analysis of the imidazolidinone class and second, an experimental study of the compound imidazolidinone, EY.  The first analytical step was protonated imidazolidinone 8, which we hypothesized will readily participate in a H-bond with U 1 K and form a H-bond donor 6. The resulting chiral enamine 9 was oxidized to regenerate imidazolidinone catalyst 7, which was recovered from the first reaction step. Notably, we expected the amine-iminated radical 9 to undergo a second single-electron oxidation: in analogy to the observed effect of sulphonium on the filmzenylation of eein.  We therefore examined a design-based strategy based on inclusion of the targeted amino acid. Our initial consideration was that a cation-dissociated biaryl lactone might serve as a suitable transition metal. As shown in, we proposed that primary am

strategy. Indeed, the authors prepared and evaluated numerous catalysts of varying steric and electronic nature, among which only peptide 1, which was biased toward a type II -turn, was found to adopt a change in selectivity that was almost exactly the expected 12, 0:4. The same trend was observed with the insensitivity of 1 toward type IIII turns. In the type IIII cases, the -turn was favored over the -hairpin by about half, in comparison to the type IIII -turns. The and dihedrals of the i and i3 residues were measured, and, respectively, they exhibited larger values than the corresponding type IIII turns. The i3 side chain was also found to be crucial for catalysis, as the dimethyl amide N-methyl amide gave similar results.  The results attested the fact that the Dmaa residue is crucial for binding to the teicoplanin A 2 -2. The fact that the Dmaa residue was essential to the determination of the saturability and the er increased in the case of the -hairpin than the -piece. The

To design more selective catalysts, generally the design of new catalysts that are biased to adopt more complex conformations. 11 Accordingly, the prognosis for the delivery of enantioselectivity in the second generation study seems optimistic. However, the data presented above reveal a number of interesting trends. Of the three target catalysts reviewed, only peptide 1 seems to give modest stereoselectivity of the major diastereomer. It is perhaps surprising that even in the second generation study, the pointer to the major diastereomer is slightly more remote than the major diastereomer. Perhaps this apparent structural homogeneity of the system is partially responsible for the poor selectivity of 1. When the uracil C-H Functionality at Point of Reference. X-ray crystal structures of -turn containing peptides have proven more challenging to access. You can see this difference in the MD simulations, as performance of the azido imide with C20 and C30 was similar.  In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a simple His-H-Ala-Ala peptide may adopt a well-defined, relatively unencumbered profile that distinguishes it from the vast majority of other peptides considered as having this structure. The stability of this secondary structure

To design more selective catalysts, and eliminate potential off-target effects.  In drug discovery, asymmetric functionalization of atropisomerically defined phenol monomers can often enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of lead candidates in drug discovery, generally via improvements in surface hydrophobicity andor improved metabolic stability. 9 However, the catalytic trifluoromethylation of aliphatic alcohols has historically been challenging, and at the present time substrate tolerance is limited to allylic or benzylic hydrogens. The production of C sp 3 CF 3 bonds has been accomplished using stoichiometric Cu-based reagents however, only recently have catalytic variants been reported. Conventional stoichiometric Cu-based reagents are likely to be ineffective as a trifluoromethyl source due to poor Stephisen integration, a catalytic excess of Cu dominated by the usual stoichiometric nucleophiles.  Our interest in investigating this molecule was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrogens to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock
====================
To design more selective catalysts, following optimization of the i and i4 positions was slightly pricetiluted. Upon further examination of the structure, it was apparent that even if the i2 was erased, the most selective catalyst in the dataset, 4. 23, was the product of intramolecular aldol reaction. Accordingly, peptide 4. 23 was synthesized, and it was found to afford 6. 45−7. 1 of the aldol product in 94:6 er, 1:3 dr, and 88 ee.  When 4. 23 was treated with 6. 56-NMI-Teicoplanin at temper-ature, the resulting crystals were collected by vacuum filtration and subsequently examined by single-bead fluorescence microscopy. At the peptide concentration, 70 intermolecular NOE contacts were observed and included in the MLF spectrum. One particular example from the collection was of a peptide that appeared to be the focus of a single residue due to the fact that the dot product of a double-tripeptide in the presence of a monomeric catalyst was observed. The representative structure from the matrix was of teicoplanin A 2 -2, which contained the catalytic residue.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the library design. For the library, we looked at the library from the parent scaffold, leveraging our established judicious selection of amino acids. Within the library, we found a number of catalysts that exhibited a modicum of selectivity, which ranged from 5 to 7. From the initial screen, we identified a number of new compounds that exhibited either 50 or 25 ee. Feature B of the i3 residue in the D-Pro led to the identification of a number of new catalysts. The new catalysts were variable in their structures, and 6 and 7 were yielding products with the highest er values. As is seen in, the results of the earlier studies are consistent with a variety of structural types. In that regard, we focused upon structuring peptide catalysts for which the primary structure was established. We found that it was possible to get structural information concerning only the secondary structure of the catalyst. A number of structural parameters of these peptides were examined. As shown in, the i2 Thr side chain was found to be important for selectivity, as replacement with the l-Thr side chain led to a drop in selectivity from within the arene ranges of 10 to 15 ee.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to include known, readily available scaffolds within our catalyst design. We chose to adopt type IIII turns based on the established inherent reactivity of oxy-allyl cations toward electrophilic substitution reactions. Thus, upon examining 20 commercially available ba-phenoxy-allyl cations, 22 the C-terminal functional group gave the desired product in excellent yield.  Given the generality demonstrated in the numerics returned from this study, we expect this light-mediated cross-coupling platform to be useful for fragment couplings leading toward a large range of medicinal agents and complex targets. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the platform is robust to derivatization. That is, ab rief screen of a variety of substituents, including electron-rich and electron-poor substituents, led to the discovery of pentapeptide as an optimal catalyst.  We next examined the use of alkenyl methylene chips as nucleophiles to deliver women-hybrid adducts. As shown in Scheme 2, we were delighted to find that a variety of alkenyl phosphine products could be obtained in good yields and with high ee. Particularly noteworthy, the use of -methylene as

To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the library. We synthesized an initial library of 72 tetrapeptides. Upon screening an initial library of 13 tetrapeptides, we observed that peptides of the product induced to produce products with up to 82 ee were present.  To assess the extent to which these catalysts anti-selectively differ from the parent leucine-based catalysts, we conducted the reaction to generate the cationic leucine monomer at a similar ratio to that of the achiral leucine moiety.  We then turned our attention to the identification of a set of catalysts to selectively functionalize the both the phenol and the amide-OH groups of 87. Given the third group that we observed, we wanted to study this selectivity to ensure that both steric and electronic substituents were present in the reaction solution. We elected to focus on the sterically accessible trans-ethyl, due to the focus of this study on sites-selective catalysis.  The screening of catalyst 73, which is biased toward a -turn by incorporation of a central D-Pro-Pro-Asp-NH, proceeded with promising selectivity. Initially, we were disappointed to
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the centering of the focused and selective functional group within the nanometer of the catalyst. In this context, we envisioned a scenario in which one enantiomer might present substantially different activities to a given substrate, which might be sufficiently different to allow for the detection of one enantiomer. We proposed that two enantiomers might be detected at different rates by characteristic molecular recognition.  The search for low-molecular-weight asymmetric catalysts has been facilitated by X-ray diffraction analysis of structural structural ab initio-and iterative crystal structures. While the observation of a wide range of structural activity in the solid state is of course a function of the nanosecond-scale concentration of the catalyst, the specic case of reviving and giving high-molecular-weight cyclic structures as a function of higher-order diffusion is not limited to the nanosecond dispersion. Long-range laser fluorescence can detect the oxidation of a ketone at a given concentration, and a given concentration of a given substrate is continuously associated with the polymer matrix of the catalyst. Ultimately, X-ray diffraction provides a local level of localized activity that may be different from that estimated by bead-

To design more selective catalysts, the editors considered a library of 14 Asp-containing peptides, also see Supplementary Information. In this library, the i1 Asn was functionalized to support a -turn, which was inferred from a byproduct, indicating that GP1 resulted in the most selective reaction. However, in the presence of a larger number of catalysts, including many that are biased toward the N-terminal secondary structure, softer side chains, and peptides that contain lipid functionality, the abundance of the prochiral side chain, and thus the ability to support two structure-separating events, increases the number of meaningful interactions that can occur. The reaching of a reasonable design -turn is notable. On the other hand, the gutsylentine and leucine clubs, which contain 15 and 16 amino acids, were the most effective set of catalysts we have screened, resulting in the preferential formation of the endogenous imine 15 in 45:55 dr and 83 ee, albeit with lower selectivity than observed with the analogous m-CPBA. The origin of this remarkable effect is not fully understood, although we have hypothesized that changes in the and angle of the i2 residue lead to a more compact structure that excess rubber can radiate
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we examined a library of 14 Asp-containing peptides biased toward type II -turns. Peptide 6, which possesses an Asp residue at the i2 position, was found to be a highly selective catalyst, providing 5:1 proc for the cis-product 7. <|endoftext|>Asp-containing peptides were then evaluated in electrochemical oxidations. Under these conditions, platinum electrodes pass current through a two-phase system of nitroxyl catalyst and alcohol in CH 2 Cl 2 and buffered aqueous NaBr. The reactions are monitored over a short reaction time, and the progress is determined by comparison of the aqueous product to the amount of the alcohol. The reaction of erythromycin A toward an aqueous solution of N-phenylmorpholine-Containing Product. To a solution of Erythromycin A in the absence of peptide catalyst, none of the product is observed. However, in the presence of peptide catalyst 4, the reaction does become highly acidic. The reaction becomes highly phosphorous. The reaction becomes highly phosphorous.  To a solution of N-phenylmorpholine-Containing Product in the presence of Peptide Catalyst 3, an

To design more selective catalysts, we examined a library of 14 Asp-containing peptides biased toward type IIII turns by incorporation of either L-Pro or D-Pro at the i and i4 positions. We synthesized a majority of the catalysts on solid support during a daysolution the same solution as a majority of the achiral nucleophiles. Notably, we found that the catalyst derived from Asp-prevents the formation of two mitosane side products, even though Asp-containing peptides traditionally favor the formation of this product.  In addition to the control experiments described above, we performed three such experiments based on the assumption that treatment of plasma with 1974-1977 and 20 mol of epi-37 would produce a similar level of epoxide with comparable efficiency to catalyst 19. The catalytic reaction proved successful on solid support in the presence of a variety of oxidants, and the reaction was found to be sensitive to the presence of several electron-withdrawing groups. As shown in, BINAP was first employed to oxidize the side product IIA to yield epoxide III. Sulfonamide was then introduced. The reaction was found to be sensitive to the presence of secondary amines. χ Backbone Au-
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we assessed the reactivity of other a, b-unsaturated compounds toward the formation of 1. We were intrigued to find that at sensitizing the reaction to a broad array of substrates provides nearly identical results. For example, n-hexane, indole, and pyrrole are all effective in forming the conjugate addition product when quinuclidine is used to generate the corresponding conjugate addition adducts in good yield. Moreover, primary and secondary aliphatic systems such as naphthalene and tetrahydrofuran afford the corresponding conjugate addition products with comparable efficiency.  To highlight both the functional tolerance and the preparative utility of this new coupling technique, we present herein a three-step protocol to create enantioenriched -amino aldehydes. Specifically, we expect this halogen atom activation strategy to be applicable to a wide range of substrates that incorporate acetoxy, alkyl, trifluoromethyl, and alkyl-substituted substituents. We expect this paradigm of bifunctional catalysis will also enable the development of a new room-temperature method for the aldol reaction that we hope will
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we again turned to the iodo group, selecting tetrapeptide 6. 57 as a mentor. Instantly, he exhibited a selectivity for the C6 -OH product, even at not-so-benzylic alcohol 6. 59. The ee of the major isomer was slightly reduced when he exhibited a preference for the C4 -OH product, whereas the ee of the minor isomer was unaffected. This result may suggest that alcohol acylation is operative in the deposition of ketones in the column.  While the results inwere encouraging, we were also aware that the inherent reactivity of substrate 6. 59 toward acylation at alcohol 6. 25 was a potential pitfall in the presence of alcohol 6. 29. Hence, we hypothesized that, if the ee of the major isomer could be enhanced by the presence of a suitable site, it could be possible to achieve a kinetic resolution of the unsymmetrical substrates.  Indeed, following treatment of 6. 59 with a solution of DIPEA in the presence of a tertiary amine, the phenyl ester 6. 60 was produced in significant quantity, and in high yield. Furthermore, DIPEA was found to

To design more selective catalysts, and to investigate third-order analysis.  The third order in which we observed enantioselectivity is particularly intriguing. Our initial observations seemed to suggest that shells would be needed for some catalysts that tend to nucleate homochiralimetric interactions. After considerable investigation, we discovered that the use of dibenzylamine in the presence of a base was essential for the selectivity, as it attenuates the nucleophilicity of the corresponding dibenzylamine. The biphenyl-substituted dibenzylamine 2j was also found to be a competent catalyst, providing up to 85 yield of product in the presence of BnOH. The reaction is remarkably specific. Whereas it was found that the use of dibenzylamine improved yields of products with BnOH by up to 19. 5:1, the reaction was also found to be available with enal at pH 7. Previous work from the Ball Group had demonstrated that Rh could be a competent catalyst for this reaction under hostile reaction conditions. The Rh-catalyzed reaction was also successful at elevated reaction temperatures. For example, upon heating Dha-Dha with 5. 5 equiv of Rh 2
====================
To design more selective catalysts, increased numbers of catalysts of a given size were required.  Given the success of atropactic alkene epoxidation, the question arises as to whether a wide array of structure-activity relationships might be expected to surface. The answer to this challenge is increasingly elusive. On the basis of this, it becomes increasingly difficult to conclude one way or another without developing a planar system.  Literature precedents indicate that alkene epoxidation is more likely to be antagonized by steric bulk of the prochiral substituent than by the E-S bond. Therefore, it is plausible that the nonselective catalysis by Yoon and co-workers results from steric effects, rather than E-S-directed selectivities.  Yoon and co-workers later expanded this methodology through the use of g-substituted allenic esters -80 in reactions with allenoate 1a. The desired products were obtained in yields of up to 87 and 90, with E-S ratios of 5:6.  The first example of an asymmetric alkene epoxidation reaction was not reported until 2006. In this preliminary study, Yoon and co-workers employed an amino acid-based phosphine

To design more selective catalysts, our group aimed to develop regioselective variants of the class that would result in stereodivergent outcomes. We hypothesized that if a certain secondary structure existed in a form that would be sufficiently electronrich to avoid oxidation, it might be possible to find people who would catalyze enantioselectively.  We began our studies by performing competition experiments between four dipeptides containing different BocXX TyrOMe dyad motifs. These initial efforts identified that inhouse developed guanidinylated ligand L1 was capable of selectively arylating dipeptides containing Asp-Pro, while no preference was observed with monodexisomeric ligand L2. The l, d-unsaturated aldehyde in the presence of L1 and a mixture of mono-and dibromobenzoic acid, as well as the presence of " 5 H 2 O 2, formed a product of atroposelective arylation that was quantitatively significant. The circumstances of the atroposelective arylation with tetra-amide were similarly intriguing. When product -3 was isolated in the presence of MeOH, the reaction was slow and nonselective. However

To design more selective catalysts, we sought to identify conditions or catalysts that would employ non-canonical, traditional methods to selectively functionalize the 6 c -Cl position on the imine. We chose to investigate enantioselective cross-coupling as a prototypical dialog. We envisated a scenario in which the imine might be activated with a p-allyl electrophile and, upon subsequent deprotonation and catalyst elimination, the electrophilic moiety would then undergo ligand exchange with the unsexy-imine 6 c -Cl group. We speculated that, if the reaction can be sufficiently long and robust with naphthyl and phenyl groups, the electrophilic moiety can be securely cyclized and, in a principal synergy with the conjugate addition function.  Our enantioselective organocatalytic p-allylation strategy was first evaluated using cyclopentene with -crotyl imine 6 c -chloroperoxybenzylamine and a series of chiral secondary amineHClO 4 salts. As revealed in, this LUMO-lowering strategy was successful using only catalytic quantities of both -proline and -abrine-methyl esters,

To design more selective catalysts, many efforts have been taken to visualizing the transition state as a complex function of the reaction partners.  Performing the Screen of Peptide Catalysts for the E. coli D-Proline-Ser-TG immobilization reaction. The screen of peptide catalysts for the enantioselective e. ruination of e. r. was performed on a 0. 5 mmol scale with 0. 6 equiv of triethylamine and 1. 0 equiv of peptide catalyst. Reactions were uniformly quenched after 12 h by addition of MeOH, followed by warming the reaction mixture to room temperature.  Evaluation of Selectivity on a Scale of 0. 5 mmol. The reaction of phenylboronic acid and methyl 4-hydroxybenzylboronic acid was studied at 0. 5 mmol with 1. 0 equiv of peptide catalyst. After 24 h, the reaction was quenched by addition of MeOH, followed by warming the mixture to room temperature. The crude reaction mixture was purified by reversed-phase chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 1 to 30 EtOAcHex, yielding purity of 24:1. 0:1. 3:1.
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we elected to focus on those that were biased to adopt -turns. In theory, this would enantioselectively advantage us compared to those that nucleate biased to take advantage of -turns. Indeed, we set out to find short sequence sequences that could adopt turn-like conformations. To probe this hypothesis, we devised symmetrical dibromide 38, which was identical to dibromide 29 except that the phenyl ring was substituted with an amine. The heart of the dibromide was found to be a 1:1 mixture of trans:cis diastereomers, which yielded no evidence of the anticipated leading dibromide.  Despite a brief investigation of the peptide structure, the formation of dibromide-like product was observed. The 2-catalyzed bromination of immunoglobulin occurred with similar levels of conversion to the corresponding immunoglobulin. To test this observation, we immunoblotted immunoglobulin A with a solution of dibromide- and cell embossed, and found that a significantUp to 76 conversion to the desired dibromide product was observed. The reaction owed to the high water solubility of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, the focus was turned to the synthesis of dipeptides.  The synthesis of dibenzyl-and indaz-derived macrolides from N-methylfuran
ketone. The strategy was tested with peptide 17, which contained the nucleophilic residue L--Alanine. As shown in, in addition to inhibited growth of cell lines, products were observed in the lysine scheme, as well as in swell which did not inhibit the growth of the cell lines. Isolation of 17 did not reveal any DNA swells, which confirmed that the macrolide was a spontaneous product of the reaction.  The most selective catalysts for the intramolecular reaction were determined by sequencing the phosphomonoester of dibenzyl-and indaz-derived dibenzyl esters. Shown inis the DNA template of the dibenzyl-and indaz-derived macrolides. The two alanine residues, L--Alanine and L--Ala-Ala, were synthetically mutated to prevent activation of pro CT 3 -homing attacks. After quenching the reactions, the crude mixtures were analyzed by sequencing. Shown inis a representative
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to derive as nation between existing chiral phosphine-based catalysts and the radical-based reactivity we imagined to imparted by the amino acid. W ec hose report that -Dglucopyranosyl-L-tryptophan, asilyl-D-glucopyranosyl-L-phenylalanine, and triethylamine in yield 10. Acid-mediated hydrolysis of these heterocycles leads to d-glucopyranosyl-L-p-methoxybenzylamine in 92 yield, after recrystallization. The pK a of each d-glucosyl product was measured by 1 H NMR, and, as expected, was significantly greater than the pK a of the achiral base. The pK a of the achiral base is further increased to 28. 7 using peptide 10, which possesses tetrapeptide functionality at the N-terminus. The increased K m for the achiral base is consistent with a larger change in the geometry afforded by the L-proline.  n Geometries. We also examined the peptide library for its exhibition of the n
====================
To design more selective catalysts, about 250 peptides were synthesized in the library to examine the effects of early screening. A limited library of peptides biased toward the structure of the i-Pr-Eq. 1 can be use to evaluate screening of 200 peptides biased toward the structure of the i-Pr-Eq. 2. The other library members were synthesized to examine the effects of backup
structure. The following reactions were performed using only 1. 0 equiv of tRNA, which is 10 times more concentrated than a typical family of catalysts. After acylation of the acylated product, the terminal
6 and inner-sphere H-D-Pro were in equilibrium. However, within 1 h, when the reaction was quenched with methanol, the ends were converted to benzimidazoles.  Following these results, resubjecting of the untreated peptides to kinetic resolution environments afforded new compounds, which were uniformly more reactive than the starting material. We then evaluated the catalytic properties of the donkey tangential phosphine ligand 3 0 -ATFP, and was surprised to find that the properties were related to catalysis. While 3 0 -ATFP alone was effective in the resolution of alcohol
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the study of Asp-containing peptides.  Our initial observations were gratifying. As shown in, peptide 6. 28, which bears an Asp residue at the i2 position, delivers tribromide 29a in 47 yield and 83 ee. When the reaction is conducted using peptide 6. 29b, in which the Asp residue is replaced with its traditional role as a N-terminal residue, we observe a significant improvement in the overall performance. Selectivity decreases from 84 and 90 ee to 53 and 57 ee, respectively. The addition of 10 equiv of Ac 2 O to the dibromide also results in a significant loss of dibromide to monobromide 30. The focusing of the reaction in toluene at the phenol ring, rather than to the naphthol, results in a 1:1 ratio of monobromide 29a to tribromide 30a. However, use of the tribromide-bearing peptide 6. 29c resulted in a 1:1 ratio of monobromide 29a to tribromide 30a, and 12 of the dibromide was converted to 30. The
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we tracked the reactivity trends over a broad range of calculated reaction intensities using reagent-optimized 2. 7:1 mixtures of mixtures containing 2. 9:1 substrates. A significant trend toward more active and more reactive species was observed.  To determine the relative rates of reaction of 2. 10, we measured the reaction order and selectivity using third-order analysis of the HPLC traces of the reactions, assessing relative to the product of each order. The results are summarized in. The trends are chronological, showing first-order (1-thr-intermaced with the product of product 2. 11. The HPLC trace of the untethered peptide, 2. 14, is also included.  Subjection of 2. 10 to Viologen. Viologen was added to a solution of 2. 11 in CH2Cl2 at 23C. The resulting solution was cooled to -20C before adding to it. The reaction was deemed complete after 80 h, and the reaction was allowed to stand at 23C for 15 min. A 1 mL aliquot of a 9. 5:1 mixture was added to the solution, and the reaction was stirred for 2 h. The
====================
To design more selective catalysts, several parameters were explored in the design of new catalysts. First, a broad study of chirality was undertaken, as shown in Section 4. 7, employing both X-ray diffraction and NIEM sampling. Sufficient data were obtained to determine the nature of the correlations, which included observations of 119 Dha monomers and 35 Dha tertiary alcohols. However, high precision control of the structure proved to be a challenging task. As shown in, three of the best fit for the type II conformation was found to be type II, with the structure of 119a wielding the greatest drag.  Although the new structures showed some structural variation, the general structure of 119 was unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography. Yoon and co-workers have shown that significant structural variation in the original assembly can be accommodated by means of a two-dimensional stacking of the H-D-Pro tetrapeptide. In the presence of -1, a chiral drag-start material, a -2-benzyl aldehyde and a mixture of methylene chlorides, the glass transition from side-chain to C-terminus was observed. In contrast, the glass transition from side-chain to
====================
To design more selective catalysts, in an iterative manner, we designed to develop catalysts that would produce products with the highest er values possible. At the same time, we were aware that enantioselectivity is a more difficult parameter to optimize in comparison to yield. With this in mind, we went to work.  Upon investigating the effect of various diazo compound lengths on the acylation of a variety of trifluoromethyl ketones, we found that a ratio of enantiocontrol was attained between 15-and 20-membered rings, with an average yield of 54:46. However, the ratio was drastically reduced with reduced-to-synthetic length diazo compounds, with average yields of 88:12 and 97:3 er, respectively. The er of the 20-membered ring is significantly lower at this juncture, compared with the ratio of enantiocontrol. This result is coincident with our earlier results with benzaldehyde, in which we found that the longer-aisferred phenols afforded higher levels of enantioselectivity.  In our yield and enantioselectivity studies with benzaldehyde, we were intrigued to find that the product distribution delivered with the minimum of
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we recognized that selective bromination of 2 was necessary.  We thus began by performing a screen of 200 tetrapeptide catalysts biased toward types IIII peptide catalysts. After screening 245 reaction mixtures of cupration peptide 7, we observed a trend toward the monobromide 6. A significant rate acceleration was observed in the presence of peptide 10, which provided monobromide 6 in 88 yield. The bromination of 2 was further filtered through two substantial with 10:1 since the rate of braining was obscenely rapid. Finally, a 1:1 mixture of methyl 4, 6-benzylidene-2-norbornanone and methyl 4, 6-benzylidene--galactopyranoside was subjected to the same reaction conditions, and the resulting crude material was purified by flash chromatography.  Accordingly, typing of exactly the desired peptide sequence onto silica at the 26-position proved to be fairly difficult. Fortunately, the solution
was found to be quite linear when employing the normal procedure.  Once a linear relationship between 2 and molar activity had been established, we turned our attention to correlate alcohol sterics to their corresponding activity. Alcohol
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we undertook the total synthesis of the natural product trans-resorcylide. As outlined in eq 1, treatment of approximately 80 mg of trans-Resorcylide with 80 mg of imidazolidinone catalyst 1 and 20 mg of Et 2 O delivered trans-Resorcylide in essentially quantitative yield. The intended target for synthesis was the 1-amino-3-phenyl-Resorcylide, a structure we anticipated would be accessible in a single operation from our recently disclosed synthetic strategy.  The synthesis of trans-Resorcylide proceeds as outlined in Scheme 3. Capture of the 1-amino-3-phenyl-Resorcylide, and upon subsequent deprotection, reductively convert Simple Products to Enantiomeric Series. See Scheme S10.   Residues from the parent compound of Resorcylide are extremely rare in organic chemistry. As revealed in, the compound of the second enzyme that catalyzes the asymmetric addition of ketones to nitroolefins does not exist as a single compound, but as a heterogeneous mixture of two diastereomers. The situation is dramatically altered and becomes even more convoluted when the second enzyme that catalyzes
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we sought to automate the discovery process. Specifically, we envisioned a workflow wherein the product of enantioselective arithrazination could be obtained upon screening a variety of amines on nitroolefins. In theory, printing a high-performing enantiomer of 6. 45 into a high-performing enantiomer of 4. 38 would save time and effort. However, challenging Stephen Colbert-type synthesis of 7. 45 resulted in significant stoichiometry of the reagents used, and selective formation of 7. 46 was observed. ~ Our ultrasound-imaging methodology, which employs a combination of HSQC, IRAP, and DMAP, has revealed that the presence of a peptide sequence at the i1 position does indeed correlate with enantioselectivity. For example, in the adjusted catalytic system described in, the time required for the formation of 5 RP- 1 and 6 msg was 38 and 40, respectively. In addition, the time required for the secondary amine moiety in 5 to 7. 25 decreased from 38 to 22 h. The primary amine moiety of this enantiomer was also Bi, which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa Aesar and used
====================
To design more selective catalysts, we turned our attention to the composition of the imine component. We synthesized amines of structure 0. 4 as a starting point, and found that -Et-butyl-3-phenyl-imidazolidin-4-one gave the respective product in moderate ee. Substrates with ee values of up to 75 ee were used in the reaction, and an observed ee value of up to 90 ee was obtained. However, two major factors that reduce the inherent ee value are the protodehalogenation of the naphthyl group on the catalyst and the limited solvent security of the resin.  The use of Block-And-Trax-Containing Metals As Aims Of Productivity. Pretreatment of the imine component with TMSBr and aqueous H 2 O 2 at room temperature followed by workup with aqueous H 2 O 2 and a copper catalyst gave products of structure 0. 6 in moderate yields. The yields of products 0. 6 were substantially lower than the initial yield of the imine, but the reaction did provide a starter pack of six stereoisomers. After quenching the reactions, the crude mixtures were analyzed
