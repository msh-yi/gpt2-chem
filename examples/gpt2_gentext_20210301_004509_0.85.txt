Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of tertiary aliphatic aldehydes. Given that the rate of reaction between secondary aldehydes and endo-iron aryl halides is comparable to that of proline-catalyzed aldol reactions, we expect this complementary method to be readily applied in the modification of a ketone.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last four digits of the alanine structure, which we observed by X-ray crystallography, are consistent with the presence of two primary and two secondary structures. The primary structure of alanine is characterized by a type II -hairpin secondary structure, which bears an additional homologue within the -turn motif. The structure of the C-terminal homologue is still under study, as it appears likely that a number of conformers exist within its structure. The 10-membered ring, in particular, could be involved in a hydrogen bond with the NH of the i1 carbonyl, perhaps explaining the predominant product in the structure. On the other hand, the structure of 1 could be explained by the presence of a type I -turn motif. The

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly electrophilic -amino acid that can selectively functionalize the -carbon of the o, o-dimethyl-substituted enamine. In doing so, we have solved a long-standing challenge within our lab, 4-versus 6-positional differentiation in myo-inositol phosphates. We have shown that when both free and electron-rich amines are subjected to the same reaction conditions, a highly selective reaction occurs for the 6, 7-olefin. Given the prevalence of the use of Pd in biomimetic research, as well as the commercially available phosphine thiolate, we expect this light-mediated cross-coupling method to be immediately applicable to the synthesis of other biologically relevant inositol phosphates.  The application of our recently reported photoredox-catalyzed trifluoromethylation strategy to the synthesis of inositol- phosphates is complex. Although the primary focus of this work has been the direct synthesis of F 0 -F c -H a -D with desirable chain lengths, we reasoned that amines of structures with three contiguous stereocenters and so forth could be readily generated. We thus devised symmetrical
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective -benzylation of carboxylic acids with enal, alkenyl, alkenyl-and aryl halides. A significant benefit of our approach is the ability to generate side-chain radical cation intermediates under mild conditions that can then be intercepted by dialkyl or alkyl halides. In this way, the photocatalyst-mediated reduction of the side-chain radical cation enables the subsequent olefination of alkyl and vinyl halide esters without the need for a reducing agent.  In our initial studies, we discovered that the use of ppy 2 as the photocatalyst was essential for the reader, presumably due to the lack of a standard reaction in the LC Me of the product. This could be the case in the presence of amine or alcohol nucleophiles. To our delight, we found that the use of DME provided the requisite reducing agent while providing comparable yields of the desired product.  At this stage, we next examined the use of liquid chromatography to quantify the relative rates of epoxidation performed in each of the two solvents. To a solution of 8 and i-Pr 2 NE
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to perform a highly enantioselective -functionalization of simple carbs. This dual catalysis strategy has now been applied to the ketone region of simple sugars, generating a library of amide-and aldol-compatible products.  One of the most immediately recognizable signs of the Petri curve is the backbone dihedral angle. What else could it be said that the backbone angles were influenced by steric bulk at the i and i1 positions, relative to those of the peripheral residues.  The N-methyl-2-phenylcarbamate subunit of the glycerol backbone is important. Not surprisingly, the presence of the other carbamate units in the structure provides some decrease in the backbone angle. At the same time, the aliphatic side chain on the i1 carbamate is oriented out of plane and no such donation may occur, resulting in a powerful shallowering interaction. The fine balance between the backbone and the side chain appears to be important for efficient catalysis. This is especially true in the type IIII -turn structures, in which the carbamate is oriented out of plane.  The importance of the i2 carbamate was also detected in the midrange region of the structure, as represented in.
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of unactivated aldehydes and ketones. A current challenge is the selective derivatization of the cation story. On the basis of the literature precedent for Lewis acid catalyzed hyperconjugative a-arylation, we expect that a catalytic dose of chiral Lewis acid should be beneficial. Given the success of ketone a-functionalization, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile approach to be widely applicable in the synthesis of a variety of structurally diverse, drug-like compounds.  Preliminary studies in our lab focused on the intramolecular Stetter reaction, employing conditions that had been previously established for the direct a-arylation of isoamino carbonyl compounds. Notably, we were pleased to find that the use of catalyst 4 led to the recovery of formyl anion 6, which would subsequently undergo b-functionalization with useful levels of enantioselectivity.  On the other hand, the method that we have independently developed for the selective activation of pyrazoles remains highly applicable. For example, the pyrazole anion can be activated by exposure to cyano-substituted imines, albeit at low rates
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of urea 7. 44 with an imine 8. 1. The ability to achieve high enantioselectivity while leveraging a non electron-withdrawing functional group speaks to the super-stoichiometricity of this transition state. We believe that the best catalysts will enable a Lehrichtype mechanism to emerge, which will reshape the paradigm in favor of the carbonyl-directed endo. This will increase the potency of the imine and willalso increase the degree of its primary amide NH bond. The outcome is a frontier activity in the developing area of asymmetric catalysts that modulate regioselectivity. We are currently engaged in the study of chiral phosphoric acid and are contributing to the answers that we giveic anion.  Phosphine-and Amine-Selective Coupling of Oxidized and Dyne-Alkenes. In our previous study, we reported the selective synthesis of five new amino acids from the decarboxylative carbonyl of aspartic acid in the presence of the ammonia; t-Bu, and K 2 CO 3. In contrast to the

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective -turn sequence that seamlessly incorporates photoredox and transition metal catalysis. This strategy was successfully applied to the CH functionalization of a variety of natural products and pharmaceuticals. In his previous work, Zhang et al. studied the arylation of amino aldehydes using halide-and Brnsted acid catalysis. In their studies, the onionrace intensifies the absorbance of the ethereal reactivity by a factor of four. The activated species are highly reducing, having a reduction potential of roughly one. If the analenylide substrate 24a is exposed to the same sequence, electron-rich silyl ether 24b is produced in an analogous manner.  The four-component reaction mechanism outlined in This work constitutes a new strategy for the generation of a locally functionalized spatiotube. It is a conceptually novel approach, which we anticipate will be broadly applicable in academia and the pharmaceutical industry.  Gravitational-Raphosine. In 2014, a puzzling archaeal protein, warts among others, was observed to mediate the desymmetrization of chalcones via enantioselective a-alkylation of the phenolic
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the aldol reaction between allenoate esters and R, -unsaturated aldehydes.  The reaction we set out to explore initially is the cyclization exhibited by the amides of -peptide catalysts we had previously developed. In analogy to the work of MacMillan, we began by exploring co-catalysis with proline and N-methylimidazole. Control experiments revealed that l-proline and two different combinations of l-proline and NMI were intimately involved in product formation. When proline was coupled to the C-terminal of the peptide, the reaction mixture was exposed to two sets of conditions: first to a set of catalytic proline methyl ester methyl ester, and second to a set of H-Pro-Pro-Asp-NH-TG, wherein the Asp side chain was absent. To our delight, the use of proline provided the desired product in comparable yield to the results observed with the peptide alone.  Since the catalyst could be developed without the use of proline alone, we asked if proline might be used to activate a proline-sensitive ASE,
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of amines. Specifically, we hoped that a halogen abstractionradical-nickel recombination mechanism might bypass this oxidative addition problem, thereby rendering a novel cross-coupling pathway for the construction of C sp 3 C sparchitectures. As an important design criterion, we recognized that the use of alkyl halides for both reaction partners would remove the requirement for substrate prefunctionalization, thereby reducing operational complexity while expanding the scope of available structural
fragments. Furthermore, the reduction in step count would allow for streamlined synthetic sequences and decreased costs.  On the basis of recent work from our lab involving nickel catalyzed a-arylation of aryl halides, we were confident that reductive amination of these alkyl halides would be feasible. As shown in Scheme 2, we envisioned that visible-light excitation of the Irand we presumed it would undergo reduction by a silanolate resulting from reduction of the Ni salt to provide a b-silyl radical and a corresponding Ir IV species. Given the established oxidation potential of prototypical amino acid carboxylate salts, we expected this reduced oxidation potential to be transient, providing an alternative pathway to the
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective -benzylation of simple ketones. The ability to achieve high levels of enantioselectivity while controlling the stereochemical outcome of a given reaction coordinate seems to us a fundamental goal.  The first applications of our photoredox-catalysis platform to enantioselective ketone allylation were reported shortly after Lus report of the poly-L-phenylalanine derivative. As shown in Scheme 1, treatment of enone with aryl aldehydes and imidazolidinone 2 while simultaneously employing the Photoredox catalyst Ru 3 2 provides the requisite -hydroxyketone product while achieving 80 ee.  The venand line, which divides the enone into two unequal-mix, is commonly used as a screening tool for the identification of Enantioselective Peptide Catalysts. In this context, we recently questioned whether a tetrapeptide could be generated and apply as a catalyst for the kinetic resolution of a variety of racemic substrates. To initiate our study of enantioselective peptide-catalyzed kinetic resolution, we subjected substrate 6 to the conditions shown in eqn. After 24
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective reaction. This dual catalysis strategy was successfully applied to the a-alkylation of aldehydes and electron-deficient ketones, which are among the most used in drug discovery. As revealed in, a broad range of ketone-derived enolsilanes that exhibit diverse electronic and steric properties readily participate in this direct a-allylation reaction. For most substrates, the choice of enol generation method does not significantly change the enantiocontrol, entry 2, 78 yield, 91 ee, entry 3, 84 ee, and entry 4, 78 yield, 90 ee.  Interestingly, the most selective a-allylation catalysts are also able to address a-allyle Surfactants. As revealed in, a catalyst developed under our senior labelling methodology called tetracyclium tetra-Pb-Phe-OH can catalyze the a-allylation of styrenes under very mild conditions, providing the corresponding a-allylated esters in up to 92 ee.  Interestingly, a catalyst developed under our earlier labelling methodology called tetracyclium oxalate was successful over a somewhat longer reaction time
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective protocol for the photoredox-mediated oxidation of -amino acids.  Our enantioselective ketone-Phe-alkylation was first evaluated with cyclopentadiene 24, imidazolidinone catalyst 1, and a series of metal oxidants. The reaction was found to be extremely sensitive to reaction conditions, with trace amounts of product produced under almost identical reaction conditions. Improvement in reaction yield was observed when the reaction was conducted at room temperature, presumably because of the increased solubility of the imidazolidinone catalyst at room temperature. The reaction was also successful in visually impeding the formation of side-products, which include dehalogenation and dimerization products, and the formation of byproducts, which include analogues of the ketone that were obtained. In contrast, ketone na-ketone 25 was found to undergo facile oxidation at 50C using the same catalyst, entry 2. These results are consistent with the Ullmann-Goldberg coupling model, in which the catalyst could be switched on for specific substrate activation.  Peptide catalyst 4 was used to examine the interaction between a substrate of interest and the catalyst
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective reaction. Using this synergistic catalysis approach, along with a mixed surfactant, benzoic acid, and a yield of up to 67 can be achieved.  The synergistic merger of photoredox and transition metal catalysis has enabled the development of a general room-temperature protocol for the a-oxidation of enones. Along with earlier work from the Ball group, they showed that a dual photoredox palladium catalyst system could facilitate the direct a-hydride addition of ketones to nitroolefins. At this stage, the nitroolefin is believed to be functionalized with a carbodiimide, which generates a transient peracids in solution. Studies in the field of the a-oxyamination of nitrogen nucleophiles have demonstrated that diketopiperazine derivatives can be useful in this sense.  The direct a-oxyamination of ketones with neopentyl phosphine catalyst 73, which is based on a partly pyrrolidinopyridine-derived imidazolidinone, was demonstrated in the presence of cyclopentene 75 to provide the corresponding a-oxy adduct 76 in good yield and
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective catalysis platform. Significantly, this dual catalysis strategy can be implemented to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering new challenges for theory and experimental analysis. We expect this new bond forming technology will find application in the construction of both natural products and medicinal agents.  Our enantioselective halogen atom abstraction strategy was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl malonate as the two functional groups, along with a catalyst combination of Ru 3 Cl 2 and imidazolidinone 6, and a 26 W fluorescent household lamp. To our delight, we found that the use of the proper photocatalyst 1, which is 80 times more concentrated than Ru 3 , gave us a range of lower yields, but with substantial enantioselectivity. The yield of product 8 is somewhat lower, but the reaction is clean, the product is readily purified, and 15 c may be recovered to varying degrees.  Our investigation into the scope of the trifluoromethylation component began with an examination of the use of various substituted alkyl iodides. As revealed in, a broad array of reduced
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective reaction. Proper implementation of this strategy requires early screening of the potential reactive species, as screening of high-molecule-weight molecules is relatively straightforward.  However, techniques that can discriminate between several products, either by taking advantage of the inherent reactivity of particular products or by developing additional complementary catalytic variants can be particularly powerful. With this in mind, we questioned whether the specific reactivity of particular products could be targeted based on the molecular complexity of the interacting sites within the crystal structures. For example, if the presence of a primary amine were changed to the corresponding methyl amine, would the selectivity be lost in comparison to the methyl ester variant. Indeed, the histogram of the acylated-catalyzed acylation of O- -phenyl-N-methyl-N-phenylalanine shows a clear trend of exponential increase as the methionine concentration increases. With this in mind, we hypothesized that the use of a more reactive methionine would provide a probably more selective reaction. The effect of methionine concentration on the selectivity was minimal however, increasing the methionine concentration from 0. 25 M in the absence of a catalyst to 0
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective two-step sequence for the synthesis of -aproline-containing peptides. The path begins by investigating chiral peptide 4, imidazole-based catalyst 5, and an iminium ion precursor –6. The goal is to develop a centering chiral structure that will be sufficiently rigid to resist nonbonding interactions during the course of the reaction. In this vein, we were intrigued to find that simple derivatives of THC, a powerful catalyst for the activation of glycosides, were effective over a broad range of substrate-types, although the trifluoromethyl moiety provides the highest level of enantiocontrol at the expense of some product leeway. The efficacy of the simple derivative, 8, may be correlated to the structural structure of the peptide. For example, pyrrolidine and methyl pyrrolidine, may be considered as two separate classes of structurally distinct products, differing only by the stereochemical configuration of the aliphatic carbon.  We then turned our attention to the question of whether or not the -turn could be a key component in the enantioselective line of
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-alkylation of aldehydes. Continued efforts will focus on addressing the issues that exist in the a-methyl substitution class, which includes sterically demanding substituents on the imine.  In addition to the exclusively a-methyl imine substrates, ketones that incorporate alkyl and heteroatom substituents at the -position were found to be viable substrates for this protocol. For example, a variety of substituted allenoates can be employed in the reaction to provide -allylated esters with up to 96 ee.  Similarly, the a-heteroatom substituent can be introduced at the A-position to give a-heteroatom-substituted products with only a slight increase in enantiocontrol. The introduction of alkyl substituents at the A-position is particularly notable. As shown in, catalysis with other catalysts that contain a range of catalytic metal species can be readily accommodated.  The effect of catalyst loading on reaction efficiency has been evaluated. While 10 mol of imidazolidinone 2 was routinely employed in the reaction, it appears that catalyst load

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to enable the direct a-arylation of amines.  Constructive connection between the Lampblack and C dOAc. The desired a-amino arylation product can be obtained in moderate yield when the reaction is performed using the prescribed dual-cycle procedure. The essential ingredient is desymmetrized amine 46, which can be accessed through the slow addition of water. Using another equivalent of water equilibrates the product from 72 to 78.  As illustrated in, a wide array of systematically differentially substituted enals can be used in this enantioselective process. For example, monosubstituted glassware can be used to integrate dibenzyl, methyl, and tert-butyl groups into the fastest reacting enantiomers of d-erythracene. It should be noted that only mono-solubstituted glasses are productive in this protocol, as exemplified by the use of 2-ethyltetrahydroisoquinoline.  In summary, we have developed a facile coupling of enantio-and diastereoenriched R-aryl ketones. The scope of this reaction has been defined under a range of conditions, and the scope of
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective hyperconjugative effect. Together, these creatives provide a highly enantioselective medium for the generation of ketone after p-addition. Krogan and co-workers have exploited this synergistic relationship to develop a highly enantioselective intramolecular a-hydroxy ketone a-allylation protocol. Intriguingly, the combination of the photoredox and thiol could enable the a-allylation of carbonyl systems that have traditionally been problematic or inert due to steric interactions in the presence of traditional reaction pathways.  The synergistic merger of photoredox and thiol catalysis has also been exploited to develop a highly enantioselective d-arylation protocol for the a-allylation of unactivated aldehydes. The utility of this method was demonstrated in a later disclosure for the direct a-arylation of unactivated aldehydes.  In addition to the synergistic merger of photoredox and thiol, photoredox and amine catalysis have also been successfully combined in the direct a-arylation of a-allyl ethers. A-allylation of this type has been achieved
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to forge CC and CN bonds in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective fashion to deliver N-phthalimides. Theorexidation of this mechanism using Ru 3 2 and the alkylimidazole should provide the benzylic radical 7, which alkylates enamine 9. The resulting -amino radical 10 is oxidized by the Ir IV species to produce iminium ion 11, which is hydrolyzed to deliver 12. Major byproducts 49 arise from the byproducts of the Ir IV reaction. This byproducts leave the byproducts of the byproducts, which are generated anew using byproducts 49.  The byproducts resulting from byproducts may be reduced to order 10, where they are anti:syn in nature. However, upon reductive elimination of the Ir II species, the byproducts are converted to byproducts and again create byproducts. We have been able to successfully predict the reactivity of both the E and Z systems to give either -1 or -1 in the presence of different byproducts. Furthermore, the selection of either -1 or -1 as the starting material greatly improves the efficiency of the photoredox catalyst, relative to the byproducts generated by

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dynamic kinetic resolution that dramatically increases the rate of reactive alkylations. This strategy was successfully applied to the two-step synthesis of -apoptolidin B, a metabolite of Apoptolidin B. Upon exposure to a catalytic quantity of N, 4-diphenyl-4-hydroxy-apoptolidin B, apoptolidin A: Established onapoptolidin A. Killed by the photocatalyst. Dying: The photocatalyst was removed by vacuum filtration before the reaction was started.  Apoptolidin B C-Component Synthesis. Thus, four hydroxy-apoptolidin A derivatives were synthesized by starting with apoptolidin A at 25C. The yields of all reactions were chi-modal with Au-amide at the C-terminus, and infectious Cbz-Phe-OMe was generated by coupling the resulting hydroxy-apoptolidin A-Et 2 and the resulting byproducts. The resulting byproducts were isolated in igloo compound B, and on analytical scale they were found to be trace amounts. Sensors based on the Au-Phe-Phe-OH motif were used to compare
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective -alkylation of unactivated aldehydes with electron-deficient aryl and heteroaryl halides. This mild, yet powerful alkylation strategy supports the use of readily available and stable trimethylsilyl ketene acetals as coupling partners.  Our enantioselective alkylation strategy has been applied in the total synthesis of the natural product trans-resorcylide. As revealed in Scheme 2, treatment of octanal with our alkylation mixture followed by in situ in situ arylation with 5-hexene-2-pentenal provided the corresponding -resorcylide in excellent yield and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the alkylation of aldehydes using our other alkylated ketone -nolventive halogenation conditions provided the corresponding -resorcylide in excellent yield and with good selectivity. The synthesis of -resorcylide itself has been accomplished in seven steps from commercial materials. Nevertheless, only a single step from the corresponding resorcylide was observed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy after reaction of the allyl acetate. This easy-to-reach
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective reaction. We hope this review has highlighted that the intersection of these two spheres is more than meets the capacity of copper to catalyze enantioselective reactions.  We have sought to develop a general method to employ single Cucoordinated complexes as a stoichiometric carrier of silyl radicals. This Comment will entail a discussion of the utility of different Cucoordinated complexes as a result of their differing functionality. We believe that this type of carrier requires the presence of a suitable stapling interaction between the Cu center and the silyl radical. The article will contain a discussion of the inherent advantages of this proposed dual catalysis strategy, including the direct functionalization of C sp 3 -H bonds.  We first explored the proposed dual catalysis strategy in the context of a cycloaddition between 4-methoxybenzyl ester and ethyl vinyl ketone. Our strategy was developed using the strategy outlined in Scheme 1. We were pleased to find that a stoichiometric amount of the desired product was obtained, and successive runs of the trans-biotin mixture gave product in high yield.  Our initial target for synthesis was returned to the well-known strategy of
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -benzylation of carboxylic acids, leading to esters with high enantiocontrol.  Our investigations began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. Two critical aspects of this new bondforming method were efficient utilization of existing binding pockets as well as insertion into well-defined -turn structures.  The use of solid-supported peptides proved successful in the preparation of iodoarenes. When using simple catalysts, modification of the side chain to carry out the desired action proved to be successful. As shown in, decarboxylative radical-methylation was achieved under the optimized conditions to provide -methylene Stetter 7 in 84 yield. The achievement of this chemical reaction was attributed to the relative stability of the remaining secondary aliphatic carboxylic acids.  Graham and co-workers employed this double-edged sword in the modulation of the ketone bioavailability of peptides. His group sought to identify peptide-based catalyst platforms for the kinetic resolution of secondary aliphatic ketones.  The Graham group applied their reaction to the synthesis of -edivoxetineHCl, a medicinal agent in development for

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of alkenes with electron deficient -amino aryl mixtures. Taken together, this method can be successfully employ to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We expect this new bond forming technology will find broad application in the chemical synthesis field and could potentially have applications in medicinal chemistry.  The preparation of a tripeptide catalyst that selectively functionalizes a single amino acid on a tripeptide bead was accomplished in a single step by using a commercially available acid-Pal derivative.  We next applied this alkylation technique to the synthesis of N-aryl amines. Finding that the lipase C1 key enzyme requires a tetrapeptide to activate its substrates to catalysis, we prepared the d-proline-containing peptide catalyst at a late stage in our synthesis. Following a brief examination of the d-Pro-Pro-Asp-Pro tripeptide catalyst, we were pleased to find that the selectivity was somewhat better when the Pro group was at the
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a dual catalytic system for the aldol reaction between official and acyclic -amino acids.  Our studies began by examining the acyl anion, which would in principle, undergo facile reductive elimination to regenerate the observed benzylic acid side chain. Initially, we attempted to incorporate a pendant carbamate into the acyclic core 18, which was expected to adopt a well-defined turn as revealed in Scheme 5. In analogy to the success of our earlier studies, we attempted to incorporate a pendant carbamate at the C-terminus of the peptide sequence. Under the traditional conditions, this f enhanced the ratio of the acylation rate to the yield. Notably, we also obtained higher yields in this series than with the pentamer, which yielded reduced selectivity. We hypothesized that the pentamer could be a less reactive substrate than the hexamer, which would account for the diminished enantioselectivity.  We next examined the influence of the i 2 residue on the reactivity. Interestingly, replacing the alanine residue with a lactic acid in the presence of a normal amine resulted in lower yields, presumably due to the minimal acid co-catalyst. The
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a potent pathway for the photoredox-mediated epoxidation of benzylic alcohols.  We began our investigations into the proposed a-alcohol-directed epoxidation using milwaukee quinazolinone 1, which has been a particularly underdeveloped substrate in comparison to a number of other tertiary alcohol substrates. Milwaukee quinazolinones are chiral compounds of nature, and as such have become invaluable in the study of symatic analysis. In this context, we were able to embed a tertiary amine base in the variety of amino acids that have proven effective for quinazolinone synthesis. 14 Subsequent exposure of amino acid 11 to the accelerated oxidation, followed by deprotection, and oxidation at the tertiary amine base proved to be a key step.  With this strategy in mind, we began our investigations into the direct a-etherification using isoquinoline and 1methoxyphenylboronic acid.  We initially attempted to develop the reaction sequence around the use of 2-methoxyphenylboronic acid, an amine that has a large thermoprotection potential. Unfortunately, the use of 1methoxyphenylboronic
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide dynamic kinetic resolution through the production of additional H 2.  Experimentally, this H 2 production strategy was applied to the resolution of alcohol -3-phenyl-propionaldehyde, which is otherwise easily oxidized but not easily eliminated from its corresponding alcohol. By using the same conditions, we were able to observation the generation of up to 50 H 2 from 3-ethanol and acylation of the phenyl ester. From the kinetic studies, we estimate the H 2 generated from 3-ethanol and acylation is up to 25. 5 kJ, which is above the threshold of hydrolysis. Clearly, further studies are required if the ink is to be sucked into the bottle.  From the behind-closed-bottomed lab benchtop, a solution of catalyst 4 in DMF was produced and monitored at room temperature for 24 h. After 46 h, the crude reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and exposed to high vacuum until residual solvent and H 2 were removed to yield a mixture of products. The sample of the crude residue of peptide 4 was purified by MPLC, then ramped to 95 B over 10 column volumes to give methyl ester 6 as a white solid. Synthesis of

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the photoredox arylation of N-phthalimides. The reaction proceeds via the combination of Ir and Phe and is led by a pendant chiral phosphine catalyst. Together, these catalytic cycles deliver product 104, which is then further simplified further via a proposed integrative dopamine-model referred to as the tetra-hedron cycloaddition.  The ability to dial in functional group selectivity between a variety of nucleophiles has been accomplished using generaluline-containing peptides that are biased toward a type II -turn. These catalysts have been applied to the engender a sense of selectivity for a variety of substrates, including pharmaceuticals. In addition, the selective arylation of ethanol ensures that product 104 is obtained in 39 yield.  In the present study, we applied the strategy of collective total synthesis to the synthesis of four inositol polyphosphates. While the overview of this study is complicated by the requirement of EGFR, we have included a description of the interpretation of the data in the presence of relative phosphine and alcohol. The key takeaways from this study are that, within the context of a multicat

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -alkylation reaction. This combo of vertical integration and CO 2 catalysis delivers the result of a nanoconfinederived peptide and produces a product containing an alkyl imine. These findings indicate that peptide-based catalysts hold promise for the development of additional enantioselective reactions. While the goal of achieving substrate general catalysts remains elusive, it is apparent that small peptides contain sufficient information to differentiate enantiomers of certain substrates in kinetic resolutions. The modularity of peptide structures, the ease of incorporating functional groups into amino acid monomers, and the possibility of parallel and combinatorial syntheses bode well for
future developments in this field. Current efforts in our laboratory are focused on this and related objectives.  Since its discovery in the 1980s, Claritin has been effective, invaluable, and ubiquitous as an antihistamine. While initially used to treat allergies, 1 loratadine and related analogues have exhibited additional biological activity against cancer, 2 melanogenesis, biofilms, antibiotic resistance, as well as mood and metabolic disorders. This diverse biological activity may be linked to the intriguing conformational topology of 1a

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective reaction.  This combination of an iron coordination complex and a peptide-based phosphoramidite catalyst invokes a benzylic cation as a source of the redox. Traditionally, benzylic cations have been employed in Goldstein reactions such as an alkyl-alkylation, an aryl-alkylation, or conjugate addition reactions. However, the presence of a principal alkyl side chain in the target substrate Ar-677, a step necessary for the invention of a secondary structure, n etype through an iminium ion, n ecolletrusts the metal center. We have often found that our reactions proceed in good-to-excellent enantioselectivity, although the accompanying benzylic cation is often the case.  Given the prevalence of dihydrobenzofuran core structures, wewondered whether the amine ligand might be formed as the racemic arylation product. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized the racemic preposed form of compound B, and we found that pretreatment of B with ve-buloimide at 220 nm followed by exposure of the

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -functionalization reaction. This powerful moiety may help to activate 5. 1 to the hyperconjugative oxidation state when compared to the corresponding ester.  In every case, the -Substituent is NanoClic. As seen in, the nanosecond-range extents of this have been observed to be quite wide ranging from a few to almost all there is a relatively large thermodynamic range between these valueless molecules and their ideal housemate. The range of these oxidation states was estimated to be quite wide ranging, from 92-97. The closest approach to a called membered ketone-derived enol by synthetically useful levels of enantiocontrol was the result of a hydrogen atom abstraction from the allyllic layer.  On the other hand, the theoretical level of enantiocontrol is comparable to that of the enzyme. That is, that is, the level of stereocontrol is equivalent to an enzyme, in contrast to the level of diastereocontrol, which is equal to a lipase. On the basis of the combination of the two factors, we can propose that the reaction of Nano with the lipid of the substrate

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of tertiary aliphatic and acyclic -amino esters with electron deficient olefins that incorporate a diversity of functional groups. We recently questioned whether this dual catalysis platform could be translated to the direct functionalization of C sp 3 -halides, a class of proline-like substrate that contains a pendant alkyl chain. By applying the same dual catalysis strategy to the reduction of pharmaceutically relevant C sp 3 halides, we were able to achieve the direct a-arylation of benzylic, R-disubstituted, and R-unsaturated esters. To our delight, we found that the use of 1, 3-diamine and the corresponding dipeptide proved to be superior, to deliver the corresponding amino arylation adducts in excellent yield.  The value of our a-amine arylation protocol was further evaluated on the basis of the demonstrated ability of this tetrapeptide to functionally interact with the aliphatic core of the substrate. By using DMSO as the degressor, we were able to activate 30 mol of 6 and 700 mol of 10, allowing for the

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of aldehydes. The origin of enantio-and diastereoselectivity is believed to be linked to the structural diversity of the peptide. Studies of the helical structure of peptides have led to analyses of several of there are no direct calls for the inclusion of the helical region in the structure.  The results of our research are consistent with the model shown in, where ERCA plays a leading role. ERCA is likely termed a local analog to R-Pro-Pro-Asp-NH. Possible catalysts for the aldol reaction include N-methyl or naphthyl-substituted enals, which would generate racemic products.  In light of the information available about the mechanism of this reaction, we consider the case of aspartyl peracids 10. As illustrated in, when racemic -3-enal was exposed to our post-cyanation conditions, the product was obtained with notable ee, which improved up to 78 ee at RT was followed by a significant increase in conversion. The role of the helical region is demonstrated by the absence of hel

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dynamic kinetic resolution that dramatically enhances the reaction outcome. In this case, the stereodefined enamine 8 is converted to the primary alcohol 9, which alkylates at the tertiary alcohol. S uch the enamine 8 is oxidized to the corresponding iminium ion 10 after simultaneous SET dimerization and before hydrolysis of iminium 10.  To investigate the effect of the photocatalyst on the enantioselectivity, t he Irppy 2 -2 1 was employed as the stoichiometric oxidant. S uch that in the presence of a strong photocatalyst, the photoexcited Ir species is reduced by an external electron donor to Ir III, which is oxidized by the Ir IV species. In addition, the resulting Irppy 2 -2 1 is oxidized by the Ir III species to Ir IV, which is hydrolyzed to Ir IV. The resulting Irppy 2 -2 1 is, in principle, two equivalents longer than what would be required for the reductive elimination step but nonetheless comparable in energy to the corresponding Ir species.  We initially examined the use of the stable, easily handled Ni complex 12 as a stoichiometric oxidant in the presence of

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of tertiary aliphatic alcohols. This coupling reaction, which operates on readily available aniline and alkylamine substrates, can be accelerated by addition of a catalytic amount of 1, 4-dicyanobenzene to the reaction mixture followed by an a-proton oxidation event. In this protocol, the carbon a-amide is temporarily generated via oxidation of the corresponding amine. After oxidation, the resulting -amino a-keto esters are harvested, and reunited to the reaction mixture.  The ability to achieve enantioselective cross-coupling reactions between non-equivalent substrates is critical to the success of this a-amine C-pucker strategy. To demonstrate the utility of this protocol, we successfully applied it to the cross-coupling of C sp 3 and a variety of amines to the alkyl halide. As revealed in, the treatment of tertiary amine 7 with our photoredox a-ox catalyst resulted in a-amino a-keto esters 10 to 14 in good yields and selectivity. In addition, hydroxy-substituted imines, such as n

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective coupling of the two primary components of the substrate. This synergistic catalysis allows for the enantioselective formation of up to eight contiguous stereocenters on the pyrrolidine ring without loss in enantiopurity. In this window, the clinician adopts a typical hemiaminal ether as the two-electron coupling partner.  The synergistic catalysis between the two primary components of the substrate commands attention to the thermodynamic significance of the two compounds. The heat generated at room temperature by the two-electron oxidation of Fzo1 should be translated to the corresponding thermodynamic quantity of H 2 O 2. That is, the difference in the math is equivalent to the heat of blood and homeostasis.  The blood-and very much smaller quantities of H 2 O 2 are generated by the action of perimidazolidinone 2, which bears the stamp of the patent phrase, D I N 2.  The other major class of catalysts is inspired by the work of Lumeng and co-workers. In their strategy, a tripeptide was designed that possessed the capability to adopt -turns. The strategy was to employ a D-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to interactively conceive new bond formations that are not accessible via either pathway alone, or in conjunction with a traditional kinetic resolution. The ability to grasp the finer details of the structure can often enhance codirected evolution, or frust combat DNA focus. To achieve this goal, we imagined a scenario in which the central thatspersed functional group could be sites where nickeying and catalytic functionalities are proximal to the central emotion. It seemed likely that there might be a premium on the use of simple catalysts in this regard since their individual secondary structures could f eform. N ote: Hnigs base, Hnigs base, and Hnigs base.  Hnigs base has been used as a stoichiometric redox agent in the kinetic resolution of alcohols by producing alcoholh owever, this has not been demonstrated with regard to a variety of medicinal agents. Despite its prolific use in chemical synthesis and disposition toward charge acceleration, only two examples of catalytic Hnigs bases have been reported. In this article we describe a silyl radicalhalogen abstractioncopper capture mechanism that we hope will enable the substantial development of an enantioselective variant of the wellknown detergent-interferring H

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a powerful expansion in the range of accessible atropisomerically pure biaryl compounds.  With optimized conditions in hand, we next evaluated a diverse range of photoredox catalysts that might be employed to mediate the decarboxylative alkylation of N-phenylpyrrolidinopyridine. These reactions were explored using N-methylimidazole, phenylthionine, and a variety of amine catalysts. Simple amines, esters, and ketals were all found to be suitable for controlling the selectivity while facilitating the formation of the desired product. Moreover, the use of aryl acylides allowed for the alkylation at C-H bonds, as demonstrated in the presence of Helix. The inherent reactivity of this alkylation reaction with respect to C-H bond activation was further demonstrated using the respective alkyl and heteroatom substituents. In addition to N-methyl imidazole, which must be oxidized to obtain the desired product, we have shown that -ibrainopyrrolidine catalyzed the formation of C-3-oxy-5, 6-benzyl-2-tert

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a highly enantioselective -benzylation of R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds. As revealed in Scheme 2, implementation of our standard photoredox-amine coupling protocol at 50C using Me 2 N 2 to afford the -amino aldehyde and 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid affords the respective -benzyl aldehyde products in excellent yield.  Last, the sense of enantiocontrol is demonstrated by the production of the -amino alcohol 3 in 84 ee at 50 conversion. This result demonstrates that a -benzylation of R, -unsaturated ketones is possible.

Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-and diastereoselective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non-natural, bioorthogonal amino acids. Chief among these methods are

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a highly enantioselective -functionalization of carbonyl compounds. Yoon and co-workers recognized that the ability to catalyize a -turn using another functional group capable of forming a secondary structure in the presence of a -turn could be crucial for enantioselectivity. Immobilizing the carboxylic acid moiety of the peptide catalyst or peptide for a given reaction coordinate resulted in a 0. 1:1 ratio of the monobenzylated species and the dibenzylated product. Release of monobenzylated product 1 under these conditions showed that diphenyl phosphate is the optimal catalyst for the b-functionalization of a -turn. Since then, this catalytic method has been applied to the b-functionalization of a wide range of substrates.  Yoon and co-workers demonstrated that while the monobenzylation of a meso substrate is slow, the arrival of the dibenzyl-monobenzyl product is rapid. Evaluation of the two catalyst classes revealed that phosphine-and amine-based catalysts provide superior enantioselectivities for the dibenzylation of a variety of a, b-unsaturated
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective -functionalization of carbonyl compounds. While direct oxidation of benzylic aldehydes is possible, the -ketene is favored over activation of the carboxylic acid by competing for the same space in the catalytic cycle.  Daugnberg and coworkers reported that adding of a single amino acid to a polyamide at a specific position in the tripeptide catalyst allows the formation of a deeptide with symmetrical and unsymmetrical side chains. The deeptide is able to catalyze the aldol reaction of acetone and isochromide in neutral solution at pH 7. Previous work from the group had demonstrated that Rh could be a catalyst for the selective activation of a number of amino acids. In contrast, Rich and coworkers reported a study of dipeptides as catalysts for the directaldol reaction. They found that peptides containing thin dendes allowed for selective activation of amino acid-containing side chains. Rich and coworkers quickly recognized that the same catalyst may be used for both functionalizations of both axial and equatorial phenyl esters.  Rich and co-workers quickly located a set of peptide

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a highly enantioselective -benzylation of simple ketones with enantiocontrol over the volatile ester moiety. This result presents a complementary technology to direct Fzoi-ENI activation to the corresponding alkyl-alcohol substrates.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu  DFT optimization used a B3LYP 6-31G basis set with benzene as the solvent.  In the context of nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling, metallaphotocatalytic strategies have been successful in further promoting challenging bond formations under mild conditions. Such advances have been attributed to the efficient photoactivation of reductive elimination steps to forge CC, 811 C O, and CN 14 bonds by either oxidationor excitationof Ni intermediates. Oxidationinduced reductive elimination mediated by photoinduced ET has been implicated in a recent mechanistic study by Nocera and co-workers. They showed that a Ni state can be accessed via sequential ET events involving both iridium photoinduced ET and nickel oxidative addition. The mechanistic understanding of EnT-mediated reductive elimination, however, remains relatively underexplored. One such attempt

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -ration with a range of p-rich nucleophiles. The ability of a -amino a-carbonyl to readily undergo a-arylation in the presence of amine catalysts provides a complementary way to the direct treatment of carbonyl-containing compounds. In this method, reversible a-arylation can be followed by in situ a-acylation and subsequently followed by global hydrogenolysis. As shown in, this strategy was successful across a range of carbonyl substrates. Highly regioselective a-heteroatom bond formation was observed with 4-piperidinyl, 4-piperidinyl, and 4-piperidyl. Smurprisingly, this methodology was also successful with 2-pyridyl carbamate, which bears a pendent alkyne.  We next sought to explore the scope of the a-carbonyl alkyne component in this a-heteroatom-containing biaryl construct. First, we were delighted to find that a wide range of electron-rich alkylenes were feasible. As highlighted in, a variety of substituted pyridines readily participate in this new b-c

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of aldehydes. Reduction of the reaction temperature to 0 C afforded a 14. 5:1 mixture of reductive a-alkyl aldehydes and a-alkyl carbonyls. The need to select a base is due to the difference in bond strength between the a-allyl carbonyls and the corresponding a-allyl oxides. The strength of the correlation between G q and A-allenic ester 1. 38, which is provided by the addition of one equivalent of H 2 to the ethanol, was used to calculate the absolute configuration of a-allyl carbonyls. All configurations were found to be consistent with the "Synthetic a-alityl carbonyls May Endorsefer has been utilized as a stoichiometric oxidant in the a-oxidation of a variety of substituted carbonyl compounds. In the interest of improving the reaction outcome, we found that the use of H 2 O at 40 8C catalyzed by 10 mol of 1 was found to afford just as high of a-allylfluoroglutamic acid 8 as the major product when a simple run of DIC
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of amines with electronrich p-rich nucleophiles. We then show that when a dual catalyst system is employed, the outcome is entirely different. For five different substrates, monohydride is obtained as the exclusive product, while primary amine 4 is the major product. The reversal in selectivity is striking, especially given that the reaction at the primary amine is quite similar to the D Ala-D Ala reaction, which delivers monohydride in 68 yield with 80 ee. We speculate that the diastereomeric a-methylphenylalanine could be a targeted substrate for this reaction, while the silyl ketene can be exploited to home in 48 yield.  The L-Ala-D-Pro Series. Thus, we next focused upon linking the l antipode of the callipeltose C-terminus to the macrocyclic core 18. Using again the Tietze glycosylation TASF desilylation sequence to combine fragments 18 and ent-18, we were delighted to find that the resulting macrolide 23 was identical to callipeltoside C with respect to the spectroscopic data obtained for the natural isolate.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide the solution to the conundrum that is the radial vicinity of a catalytic moiety that is spatially offset. This phenomenon has been demonstrated previously with the on-chip PET camera of L-phenylalanine and is under consideration in our lab.  The determination of a q is based on the equation. We propose that for the area labeled A in, the zero-order directed universe is Fz, which is wide and specifically tailored to the two enantiomers of 1. The calculated q is consistent with the NMR data and is supported by an upper bound of 1. 7. It is notable that the broader uncertainty in the denominator yields a higher number of possible conformers, which makes the upper bound less accurate. The remainder of the molecules occupying the bottom face of the helical secondary structure are calculated to be at risk for not adopting the ideal plane. It is important to note that the only difference between the optimized structures of 1 and 15 is the value, which is extremely wide in both directions. The length of the backbone of 15 is used as a common metric to determine the mean.  Assay of Enantiomeric Purity. Enantiomers of product 5 were separated by chiral HPLC employing a

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to enable the digital generation of aryl-and heteroaryl esters from the corresponding esters and ketones.  In this Commentary, I present my opinion on how chemists arrived at this point. It is useful to look back and consider this development, not least because it provides insight into how scientific communities can seemingly bypass an important area of research for many decades and then, at a given moment, embrace the same field with collective enthusiasm. I consider that three factors were crucial to the sudden birth and rapid growth of the field of organocatalysis: first, the conceptualization of the field second, the advantages of organocatalytic research and, third, the advent of generic modes of catalyst activation, induction and reactivity.  New synthetic methods are most likely to be encountered in the fields of biological and organometallic chemistry.  In the late 1990s, however, things began to change when Yian Shi, Scott Denmarkand Dan Yang, and their co-workers, demonstrated that enantiomerically pure ketones could be used to catalyse the enantioselective epoxidation of simple alkenes. Shortly after, Eric Jacobsen and Elias J. Corey described the first examples of hydrogen-b
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to enable the a-heteroatom coupling of static and dynamic reactive systems, such as alkenes and ketones.  For the linkage of static systems to stereodynamic systems, the enantioselective catalysis of glycosides and polyenes using photoredox catalysis is a frontier. Historically, chelating functionalities such as amides and carboxylates have been the principal functional groups to initiate reactions that proceed via a fixed g in the absence of a catalyst. More recently, added metal-catalyzed cross-couplings have been executed in which an various class of nucleophiles serves as a stoichiometric activator. Catalyst-dependent product ratios are obtained at unprecedented levels of enantioselectivity and in high yield. Perhaps most notably, this approach allows one to distinguish among the class of static disfavored aniline-allylated glycosides, which undergo reaction enantioselectively but with poor diastereoselectivities. Our choice of peptides for this important anilino-aldehyde coupling was based on our prior studies of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization. In contrast to the result reported by Gooen et al. , we expected products like

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -ketone a-functionalization. This combo of catalysis and enamine catalysis provides a route toward the synthesis of -p-ketoesters in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective fashion.  Keto-olefins. Keto-olefins are important molecular building blocks due to their essential role in biological processes and because of their appeal as amines. In addition to their natural occurrence, ketones are routinely produced in reactions with high levels of enantioselectivity, but methods for the asymmetric preparation of a range of enantioenriched, druglike compounds have been historically limited. The development of new methods for the asymmetric preparation of such compounds is of significant importance, especially in the chemical synthesis of diverse natural products. In this context, a-allylation of aldehydes, ketones, or esters requires a multifaceted approach in both reaction partners, including both a chiral catalyst and an achiral substrate.  Recent advances in the catalytic control of the a-benzylation reaction showed that chirality is key to reactivity, while that of the achiral catalyst offers

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to obtain lifetimes on the order of 1020 kcalmol for the phosphine-and amine-based catalysts, which is a dimension characteristic of high-functionality molecular systems. The nanosecond-range value of Bloom is characteristic of a multicomponent reaction, whereas the value approaches the limit of the practicality of the analytical size heuristic employed. The limit of practicality is approached when the oscilloscope is opened.  The data supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and its Supplementary Information.  An emerging strategy for C-C bond formation has been the application of native organic functionality as latent nucleophilic handles for transition metal-mediated cross-couplings. In this context, the use of olefin, methoxy, acetoxy, and carboxylic acid moieties as organometallic replacements has enabled a variety of carbon-carbon bond formation protocols using feedstock materials. However, the most common approach for transition metal-mediated native functionalization has been the use of C-H bonds-the most ubiquitous chemical bonds found in nature-as nucleophilic coupling partners. Among the wellestablished challenges with sp 3 C-H bond functionalization, the efficiency with which a given molecule can

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to reveal a multiple-component coupling reaction. The photoexcited Ru catalystundergoes reductive quenching, becoming more oxidized than the residual aryl urea. This elevated oxidation potential allows the in situ addition of ketones, which are typically problematic substrates for traditional alkylation methods. In the event, we were able to demonstrate that we could use the same synergistic combination of photoredox and Ru catalysis to achieve the such elusive goal of achieving a direct and enantioselective coupling of two complex ketones.  Our proposed mechanism for the photoredox-and Ru-alkylation of 2 is outlined in. We hypothesize that initial irradiation of heteroleptic iridium photocatalyst the a-amino radical 4 and the corresponding Ir II species 5.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a powerful catalyst for the selective functionalization of N-phthalimides.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes an need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylsilyl pH 7. Since the 5-HT group is normally exposed to water via the g-proline methyl ester, we hypothesized that a catalytic quantity of HN 3 might be needed to achieve this effect. Therefore, we prepared a quantity of HN 3 and evaluated its photophoretical properties with the leading compound.  The reaction of HN 3 with alcohol 1 at 60C using triethylamine and t-butyl-2-methyl-butylammonium benzene was studied for the first 60 minutes with 80 L of the peptide catalyst at room temperature. After heating

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a highly enantioselective -benzylation of simple carbonyl compounds. Our experience exploring the application of catalyst 9 to the repair of a broken peptide product instructed us to investigate whether the catalytic cycle could be coupled to an iminium ion. If the reaction could be coupled to iminium, we would expect the iminium to be kineticized under the reaction conditions. Because primesenriched R-Phenylboronic acid and R-phenylboronic acid are known to catalyze electrophilic substitution reactions, we prepared a series of chiral phosphine and amine catalysts based on the combination of R-Phenylboronic acid and a chiral phosphine-like catalyst. With our optimized conditions in hand, we tested a variety of chiral phosphine and amine catalysts. Following optimization, we found that the use of imidazolidinone 2, 90 yield, 99 ee, was highly beneficial. The enantiomeric excess in the phosphine catalysts was found to be 5-fold higher than the corresponding imidazolidinone 2. The results in terms of enantioselectivity are quite encouraging. The results of

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective protocol for the aldol reaction. While the results herein remain below medium-level speculation, a centripet approach to the synthesis of 1, a l-D-proline based h-phenol was suggested. The h-phenol can be converted into a three-step sequence that includes dibromocarbonylation, followed by oxidation and subsequent olefination. As shown in, the sequence would require a total of 25 steps for the synthesis of l, l-D-proline. Although the purification method employed is quite primitive, high endo-exo selectivity and narrow recovery time were possible.  The response of enamine to the synthetic h-phenol was studied by weighing an appropriate amount of dibromocarbonylation material into each of two vials. Stock solutions of enamine in acetone were prepared by distillation in vacuo at 80C. Enamine Resynthesis and Testing. Enantiomeric excesses were measured by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography using a Chiraldex G-TA column.  Unless otherwise noted, all reactions were carried out at benchtop conditions without exclusion of air or moisture.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the a-hydroxy a-keto esterization of saturated aldehydes. A wide array of electron donating and reducing functionalities, including a-halocarbonyls, a-chloroesters, and a-oxyheteroatoms can be readily tolerated on the aldehydic substrate. Moreover, the steric demand of the a-formyl substituent can be accommodated Me, 67 yield, 86 ee entry 8, R t-Bu, 55 yield, 92 ee. The presence of a-oxyheteroatoms may be accommodated Me, 90 yield, 84 ee.  It is important to note that the absolute and relative configurations of 2. 40 were also uniformly achieved.  In summary, we have developed a new strategy for the direct a-hydroxy a-keto esterization of saturated aldehydes. This new process can be accomplished with excellent levels of enantiocontrol using hydrogen bond donors or with relatively electron-deficient a-keto reductants.  The effect of the acid chloride component on the differential activation of the two isoprene chambers is also evaluated. When the reaction is performed in the same manner with both is

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective reaction. Reduction of the photocatalyst loading to 0. 5 mol reveals a number of linear aliphatic and heteroatom reductions are practical.  The combination of photoredox and transition metal catalysis has found broad application inorganic and materials chemistry. In particular, photoredox catalysis has been applied to the development of a library of peptide-based acylation catalysts for asymmetric aldol reaction. A recent application in the intramolecular arena of enantioselective aldol reaction is the merger of photoredox catalysis with transition metal catalysis. Peptide-based catalysts incorporate a broad range of amino acids in the search for enantioselective aldol reaction. Reactions generated under standard conditions include homogeneous products, products that are electron-rich in nature, and products that are electron-poor, which are difficult to access by other means.  The peroxide-catalyzed addition of aromatic substrates to electrondeficient and electron-rich halides is a process that has recently been utilized in the energy range 10-30 kcalmol. This range of oxidation states can be stabilized by the presence of a

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective catalytic system.  Our studies began with the synthesis of octapeptide 11. In analogy to the classic Patel ligation strategy, we envisioned a two-step protection of the resulting phenol from unnecessary colorless iminium ion hydrolysis. We envisioned that this amine-protecting strategy could be achieved in a single step from an iminium ion precursor by way of a P-catalyzed allylationlactonization. Our synthetic approach to the synthesis of 1 began with the preparation of enantioenrichedlactonized salt. Our strategy toward tolacetic acid was then completed as in. The synthesis of peptide began by synthesis of amino acids 0. 35 via P-catalyzed dipeptide catalysis. The amino acids were prepared from the corresponding esters and protected as methyl esters. Addition of the protected amino acids to the acetic acid was then accomplished in the presence of TMSOTf. The resulting peptide was allowed to stir at rt as i-Pr 2 NEt was added slowly. The reaction vessel was then wrapped in foil, and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at rt.

10, photoredox catalysts 1 or 9, and a 26 W fluorescent household lamp. Initial experiments revealed that the proposed a-iodination reaction was indeed possible at ambient temperature however, the rate of product formation was dependent on the presence of both base and light. To address the problem of double diastereodifferentiation, we reasoned that a diffraction-like effect between the a-carbonyl oxygen and the a-fluorine should transpire if the following criteria are met: molecules that undergo single-electron oxidation bear a radiolabelling pattern, and
identitate a k rel value that can be significant large or small. In the event, we found that the use of imidazolidinone 1 provided the desired product with notable levels of enantiocontrol, while the use of the bro-amyl-substituted imidazolidinone 2 led to a facile and selective a-carb

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective reaction. This dual catalysis strategy was successfully applied to the asymmetric catalytic construction of five-and six-membered carbocycles as well as the asymmetric catalytic construction of a previously unknown atropisomeric series.  In 2007, Houk and Bahèl reported a computational study based on a model wherein the enantioselectivity of a Boc-protected enantiomer is based on a multiproduct reaction involving a copper and a photocatalyst. The ligand for the copper is methyl, where Me is methyl. This explains the of course, why C-xyloxy ketones exist in the library but do not participate in a permanent, open-shell transition state.  Since its discovery in the 1980s, Claritin has been effective, invaluable, and ubiquitous as an antihistamine. While initially used to treat allergies, 1 loratadine and related analogues have exhibited additional biological activity against cancer, 2 melanogenesis, biofilms, antibiotic resistance, as well as mood and metabolic disorders. This diverse biological activity may be linked to the intriguing conformational topology of 1a. For example, loratadine and

Our lab has been exploring the intersection of photoredox and transition metal catalysis. In particular, we have shown that direct reduction of the aryl halide to a bromide or clear analogue adopts will activate a-allyl metal centers toward S E Ar the plain planar magnetic pronucleophiles possess the ability to selectively arylate the enamine and can be selectively substituted at the aryl ring. In contrast, the implementation of a functional group-tolerant approach with a diverse range of substituted allyl halides will likely lead to the same conclusion. The intrinsic value of this approach is that it provides a complementary method of accessing allyl tertiary amines and pyrazoles from the common phenolate core structure. With this objective in mind, we assumed that a halogen abstraction-radical-nickel recombination mechanism might be operable wherein a tertiary amine-rich barrier to a radical-centered radical is sufficient to enable selective arylation at

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and stereoinduction potentiated tripeptide, which can mediate the enantioselective a-oxidation of percentimeter-sized peptides. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one basic and one electrophilic residue. Catalysis with one electrophilic residue. and Cycle-specific derivatization of ubiquitous catalysts.  Studies on the a-Minimized Electron-Deficient Designer Quadruple. Inspired by the work of Ramachandran and co-workers, we assessed the acyclic performance of the peptide catalyst 5. 5 using dFx to oxidize -5. 6. Because the minimizeization of any single residue at a single site was greater than that of the multi-syn, we expected the functionalization at higher concentration to be less enantioselective. Indeed, we observed that phosphorylation of the catalyst 5. 5 was more efficient at 0C than oxidation at the multiplet center. The results in terms of enantioselectivity are remarkable.

For example, a variety of styrenes can be employed, including electron-rich, electron-deficient, as well as -amino, -oxy, and -heteroatom benzylic silyl ethers. Moreover, the use of untreated hyphenyl alcohols can result in the isolation of -hydroxyketone, a key aldol product that can be extensively used in its synthesis.  To highlight the synthetic utility of this new enantioselective -carbo-oxidation, we undertook the total synthesis of the natural product perophoramidine. As revealed in eq 2, treatment of tertenylichloroacetaldehyde with 4-methoxyphenylchlorobenzene in the presence of 20 mol of -morpholine and 1, 2-diphenylethylenediamine did indeed furnish the dihydrofuran core of amine 1 in excellent yield and with

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of simple ketones.  Our enantioselective ketone-SOMO conjugate addition was first evaluated with cyclohexanone, allyltrimethylsilane, ceric ammonium nitrate as the stoichiometric oxidant, and a series of amine catalysts. Upon exposure of cyclohexanone to our SOMO protocol, we observed the formation of a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective a-alkylation reaction. Moreover, this reaction can be conducted with two different amine catalysts: an amine of the pendent -turn type and a pendent -turn-type amine.  The mechanism of this reaction is now under study. Our current hypothesis is exploring the possibility of a stereodivergent pathway. Perhaps covalent catalysis occurs in an aqueous way, as shown in an amine-catalyzed pathway. Or, perhaps many different catalysis pathways may be operative. For the purpose of evaluating the possibility of a stereodivergent pathway, we undertook the enantioselective oxidation of -crotyl pyrrol

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dual catalytic system for the photoredox a-allylation of alcohols. Given that alcohol acylation with ketones is a common path for the formation of b-allyl carbonyls, we chose acetone as the coupling partner, which has a broad range of functional groups with respect to acyclic substitution on the aryl ring.  We next explored the scope of the a-allyl carbonyl component in this a-allylation protocol. As shown in, a wide range of functional groups can be readily tolerated on the aryl ring at the carbonyl oxygen. For example, a silyl ether, ester, alkyl chloride, plastic, and alkyl amide moieties are suitable substrates for this a-allylation strategy. Moreover, sterically demanding –branched substrates are also accommodated with minimal impact on yield or selectivity. In addition, we have found that the overbearing phenyl group of 1-em can be selectively excised from the ring via this method.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective synthesis of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters on complex peptides. In the presence of the juniperidinyl ester of -amino aldehydes, epitope 12, a-allyl-a-hydroxybenzofuran, and a variety of amine catalysts, photocatalysts, and mild base conditions, a diverse range of secondary a-allyl carbonyls can be formed enantioselectively and selectively. Moreover, the a-allyl C-H functionalization of quaternary carbon centers on secondary substrates provides a highly enantioselective platform for the development of enantioselective a-allylation protocols.  To highlight the potential applications of this enantioselective cascade catalysis strategy, we sought to develop a new class of a-allyl halides based on the catalytic production of -allyl carbonyls. Given the inherent stereospecificity of enamine -alityl halides, we anticipated that a-allyl halides might be suitable substrates for the production of enantioselective b-allylation on secondary substrates.  Our enantiose

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of simple ketone molecules. The rapid reaction kinetics allowed for the use of quinone-afforded iminium ions that are inert to basic hydrolysis and acid-mediated hydrolysis. This combination of an iminium-based ligand and a proton-based ligand ensures that the p-hydroxy iminium is thermodynamically generated when the iminium is bound.  The fertile substrate of the silyl radical 7 is oxidized to the corresponding iminium ion 9, which alkylates with amine 10. The resulting byproducts are then removed by reversible alkylation with iminium 2. This lengthy alkylation technique, which relies on the use of an oxidative quinone, allows for the direct enantioselective a-cyanoalkylation of ketones that incorporate a range of functional groups, including aliphatic, aromatic, or achiral substituents.  We initially examined the proposed alkylation protocol using the cysteine-derived silyl radical 7, an a-allyl halide, and a variety of amine cataly

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -phosphine-and acid-catalyzed cycloaddition.  Our enantioselective a-alkylation was first evaluated with octanal, imidazolidinone catalyst 1, and a series of chiral secondary amines. Initial investigations revealed that the use of 1h on a molar basis was detrimental to enantioselectivity, whereas increasing the amine concentration from 1. 25 M to 2. 5 M produced a modest improvement in selectivity. In addition, a slight decrease in enantioselectivity was observed when electron-rich amines were used. We hypothesized that imidazolidinone turnover was being inhibited by loss of H 2 for a competing reaction pathway. To test this hypothesis, we set out to find low molecular weight peptides that would reverse the inherent enantioselectivity of this reaction. A number of peptides were evaluated in the enantioselective a-alkylation of aldehydes 7. 9 with a variety of amine catalysts. Peptide 10, which bears an aminocyclopropane carboxamide residue at the i2 position, was found to

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective protocol for the aldol reaction. Prominent features of this new dual catalysis strategy include the component-selective partitioning of reactants and the use of auto-and cyano-hexenylacrylates to generate a diverse array of carbonyl, amine, or imidate motifs.  The value of peptide-based catalysts has recently been questioned. In particular, an increasing number of work has been focused on the use of specially functionalized amino acids to achieve enantioselective reactions.  In the early 1980s, two groups of henchyl peptide-based catalysts were reported: one based on the work of Gellman and co-workers and another based on the work of Wiechert and coworkers. Many of their strategies toward the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched Gelfi-Phe-OH centered on the use of non-canonical benzoic acid residues to catalyze the aldol reaction between epimine and a diisopropyl ether. Although the successful execution of their strategies required high reaction temperatures, non-canonical benzoic acid residues, and selective aqueous solvent

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide 2. 7:1 kinetic resolution of alcohols that are persistently in hydroxyproline. These results provide further evidence that the protocol described herein does not require a motor product, and can be employed as a generic nucleophilic catalyst across a range of substrate classes.  We next sought to define the scope of the aldehyde component in this new dual catalysis protocol. As shown in, a wide range of functional groups, including cyclic aliphatic alcohols, esters, amides, amines, carbamates, and aryl rings, can be readily tolerated on the aldehydic substrate. Moreover, significant variation in the steric demand of the aldehyde componententries 1, 7, and 9 is possible n-hexyl, cyc-hexyl, 4-piperidinyl, 82-91 yield, 94-96 ee.  We next applied the binaphthyl-derived amine catalyst to the target of the stereoisomeric p-methylene. Indeed, a variety of substituted alkyl amines can be incorporated on the alkyl carbonaryl ring at no apparent detriment to the reaction effort. It should be noted that only products arising

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve an efficient synthesis of -amino acid 119. This acylation reaction takes advantage of the unique nature of this pentapeptide, which allows for facile epimerization at the tertiary 2-position. -Amino acid can be prepared in a straightforward manner using the N-methylimidazole substructure. The resulting -amino acid 120 is then used in an analogous reaction to afford aldehyde 121. Removal of the protecting groups using standard methods provides the key amino acid 122. A second equivalent of NMI provides the key H-amino acid. Finally, micro-completion of the synthesis is accomplished using AD-H-O, which provides the set of -amino acids and isofuran.  The preparation of well-defined heterogeneous catalytic systems is a special challenge to heterogeneous catalysis. Despite the widespread use of a variety of metal-based catalysts, only a handful of examples with highly enantioselective outcomes have been reported. The challenge of homogeneous catalysis is much greater than the sequential addition of chiral catalysts to a broad class of heterocycles, but it is also a significant challenge in asymmetric catalysis. In the present

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to accomplish the direct a-functionalization of carbonyls.  Our lab and others have focused on the invention of novel catalytic methods that allow for the direct functionalization of other structures by S E Ar. In particular, we have shown that catalyst 4, which is based on the combination of a dialkyl-proline residue, can effect enantioselective brominations of the C Br bond, affording bromo-adducts that are structurally precluded from conventional bond oxidation. In contrast, thesemithetic approach has been directed to the discovery of nonenzymatic catalysts to modify a nearby protein by S E Ar. T he Framem cardio-and stereoselective properties of large proteins have been exploited to achieve selective tether-assisted protein modification. While the goal of optimizing the reaction for a specific substrate is challenging, the results are available if the obstacle is high.  In nature, many organisms generate large families of natural product products with a high degree of variability in structural space. The extension of this stable BVA repertoire to new classes of substrate-dependent protein polymers, in particular, would be of significant value, as such approaches are scarce.

Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a new approach to the synthesis of amino acids from scratch. This paradigm shift in the paradigm has been catalyzed by a rise in demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, including gene-centric amino acids.  Proximity-Based Biomimetic Catalysis. Inspired by the selective catalysis exhibited by the Pro-Gly octapeptide catalyst, we hypothesized that peptide-based catalysts might also enable simple allenoate esters to function as useful substrates for the site-and diastereoselective modification of proteins. In this case, the capacity to perform site-selective and stereoselective functional

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dual catalysis platform that enables the enantioselective -functionalization of carbonyl compounds. The ability to perform regioselective and sequential C-H bond erodes the overall selectivity of this alkylation reaction, but the mode by which it proceeds remains broadly dependent on the identity of the carbonyl constituent.  For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one component each, cascade catalysis with one component each, and cascade catalysis with multiple components.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single catalytic center. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, followed by much later work by Breslow and co- workers. The contribution of these early studies to the modern synthesis of the natural product is attributed to the versatility of the alkyl-Tishchenko residue, which allows for the rapid and enantioselective formation

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide the most powerful method for achieving asymmetric induction known to date.  The combined efforts of Rendstegan, co-workers have unveiled a new mode of peptide-based catalysts that allow for enantioselective phosphoramidite-based synthons. This method, termed photoramidite-directed epoxidation, generates epoxides under very mild conditions that can intercept stereodivergent reagents. When applied to the reaction of a stereochemically matched substrate, methyl vinyl ketone forms a product, which sinks to the substrate. This fate is secured by the ion-stabilizing effect of the amino acid, which helps to diffuse the epoxide to the molecular surface. In this vein, photoramidite-directed chemistry has been applied to the uncovering of a new class of peptide catalysts, which undergoes enantioselective phosphorylation of the 1-position of the amide. Findings from these studies will be reported in due course.  Note Added in Proof. Shortly prior to publication it came to the authors attention that an enantioselective boronic acid-catalyzed ketone-D-myo-inositol

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dynamic kinetic resolution that delivers up to 50 enantiomeric ratios. By using the same photoredox catalyst, we have shown that diketopiperazines of this type can be used to mediate two sequential the photoredox-and diketoproductive addition steps, where one reacts with the oxidized substrate and generates a product, which is identical in all spectra to the other.  As revealed in, a significant alteration in the dr of the reaction was observed when a, -diamino acid was employed. Originally, we had anticipated that the ~diamino acid would serve to activate the peroxide toward S E Ar, whereas the steric effect of substitution on the catalyst might render the peroxide more susceptible to oxidation. However, both reactions proved enantioselective, and within 6 h significant perturbation to the dr was observed.  We then evaluated the two catalyst classes in a one-pot, parallel processing experiment. In the case of catalyst class A, we observed a k rel 50. 1 that was substantially lower than the l-CPBA-inteutral mixture that we had observed with the primary amide-based catalysts.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of aldehydes. For the impatient b-functionalizer, this appears to be around 6-8 hr at 50C. For toluene, this appears to be around 30 min at 50C with 30 ee. Medium wets are optimal for this process, as both are easily available and affordable.  To our delight, we found that the use of dibenzyl organic compound as a suitable naphthyl acceptor quickly enabled the development of a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of aldehydes. Indeed, we saw that addition of the dibenzyl moiety gradually enables the a-hydroxy aldehyde adduct to approach the saturation point within 30 min. After the final product, we observed a doubling of selectivities. Whereas the original a-hydroxy aldehyde adduct was restored in moderate ee, the corresponding dibenzyl-and methibenzyl-substituted product was obtained in low ee.  The method we have established also allows access to racemic another a-methylene-and a-heteroaryl aldehydes

This method support the generation of up to three contiguous stereocenters on the same drug molecule. By leveraging a stereoreactive -amino acid, alanine can be generated. This has been demonstrated previously with the the deprotonation of -amino acids. Peptide-catalyzed protonation of N-methyl imidazole yields -benzyl aldehydes.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to demonstrate that oxidation of R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds can indeed be coupled to the radical cation 2, 4-dicyanobenzene to generate a highly reactive benzylic radical 3 that can readily intercept a silyl enolate.  The capacity of proline to catalyze the conjugate addition of ketones to alkylidene malonates provides an interesting parallel to the work of Prochiral and coworkers. As revealed in, during the exposure of R, unsaturated ketones to the reaction conditions, the corresponding enolates undergo spontaneous conjugate addition to form enaminated, R-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. A common scaffold among natural products and pharmaceuticals is the appearance of a -pivaloyl ester, which can be converted to the corresponding -amino acid 108 via a two-step sequence involving dinitrobenzene. 109 Activation of these enolates via conjugate addition to the alkylidene malonate provides an interesting precedent.  The suggestion that H-D-Pro is responsible for the asymmetric induction is emerging as we see it pop up in studies of sauvedi—mediated epox

The ability to achieve this level of control seems to me equally impressive in comparison to the control afforded by the kerfibrozaldehyde system.  I am interested in developing a system in which the atom of our dormant R-phenolate can be repeatedly translated to the visible-light-emitting diode of the pendent alkene. In this sense, we want to test the possibility of a double-electron pathway for the two-electron process. If the while substance of our substrate continues to exhibit significant R-phenolicity, we want to test this hypothesis and see if the resulting -carbonyl can be translated to the requisite alkene.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to allow rapid access to a diverse array of alkyl and heteroatom substituted products.  As revealed in, a wide array of heterocycles can serve as competent coupling partners. For example, electron-rich and electron-poor heterocycles are readily tolerated. Notably, the use of -substituted imines resulted in ab initio; arylation, and conjugate addition products. The inclusion of the ring-substituted asteride allows for the selective arylation of enamine 9, while the "Bl, s-Upper, and R-Phe-Methoxybenzyl variants are compatible with the photoactivation model.  We next focused upon identifying a catalyst that can selectively functionalize the 3-OH group of 9. When utilizing aqueous hydrogen peroxide as the stoichiometric oxidant and hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent, we were delighted to find that the selectivity was available. Indeed, hexafluoroisopropanol and pethanol were found to be suitable substrates.  We next examined the scope of the aldehyde component in this a-heteroatom-first-order reaction. As shown in,

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide turn-promoting and enantioselective reactions. In the former reaction, the oxidized substrate is fused to the BINOL-derived enolate, which undergoes protonation and deprotonation 8 to generate a -Cu-CF 3 species 9. In the latter reaction, the photocatalyst is deployed as a mixture of the primary and secondary amines, which are functionalized to form a matched and mismatched pairs of diastereomers. In both cases, the stereochemical outcome is dominated by the appended peptide sequence.  The application of these principles to the high precision study of catalytic residues both in complex peptide sequences and in between multiple catalytic separable catalytic cycles is now what we expect to be a significant and pervasive factor in the study of the next generation of enzymatic and small molecule catalysts.  Divergence in enantioselectivity has been observed in asymmetric aldol reactions

This protocol can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as deliver a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We expect this new bond forming technology, which provides a complementary method to traditional a-allylation catalysis, will find application in the construction of both natural products and medicinal agents.  by compound that undergo a meso functionalized oxygen atom abstraction. The limit of this strategy is demonstrated by the low enantioselectivities obtained for carbenoid insertion reactions of etoric anhydride into methyl ketone at 120 mg/ U73A. The scintillation vial can accept an oxidant at the -position, which leads to the formation of iminium ion 4 on the volume rim. At this stage, the photocatalyst can accept an electron from the prochiral enamine to give an -amino radical 5. The resulting byproducts are thus the previously discussed, namely, those generated by intramolecular radical 7.  In conclusion, we have developed a photoredox-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a highly enantioselective -benzylation reaction. Our efforts began by identifying a suitable amine catalyst for the nitromethane-and ethanol-based BH reaction. The catalyst library was designed around the architecture of the -turn-inducing residue, an i-Pr residue at the i1 position, and a range of known secondary amine catalysts at the C-terminus. Within the library were certain catalysts that selectively function as nitromethane-substituted enolates, others that are fully functionalized with a phenyl ring, and anything else that might be associated with aldehydes.  The catalyst library was subjected to the same reaction conditions, and selectivity as was observed previously was restored to 99:1 er. Interestingly, this effect was also observed within the library of diastereomeric catalysts containing a Dmaa residue at the i2 position.  When a second nitromethane was added to the reaction mixture, the enantioselectivity was nearly entirely lost. The fate of the catalytic cycle was augmented by adding one equivalent of H 2 O to the reaction mixture, which was calculated to be an H 2 O:Me2

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to accomplish a collaborative competitive European hydrogenolysis. While the scope of this reaction was determined to be limited to highly electrophilic ketenes, 7 this study first demonstrated the potential value of combined plant-based catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.  Shortly after Chans report, two synergistic catalysis strategies were introduced to the community at large. First, the directing effect of metal salt was detected. Second, a community of within the range of C sp 3 -halide cycles was discovered to be resistant to p-p stacking on the reaction vessels, which could lead to cleavage of the C sp 3 halide and many other alkyl halides from the supporting functional groups.  The community immediately recognized the value of combined catalytic and noncombinatorial approaches. First, we sought to develop a general method for the direct a-halogenation of aldehydes using tetraalkylphosphine and the readily available amines. We chose to develop upon the precedent of Bolm —who demonstrated that direct a-halogenation of carbonyls could be achieved by the addition of a terminal Dmaa to an iminium ion.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of enamine. Although the term vinylogous Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction has been used interchangeably with R-arylation in the literature, we have chosen to refer specifically to the coupling of two isopsychotyl alcohols that are effectively deterred by the two alcohols on the catalyst. Upon exposure of the resulting R-trifluoromethyl aldehyde to the photoredox catalyst Irppy 2 PF 6, we observed a mixture of products, which were formed in a high enantiomer ratio. The product of net alkylation at-the-phenyl-2-phenyl-propanol is observed as the sole product, while the yield of the minor alkylation product is modest.  In an effort to rationalize the high selectivity we had observed, we began to study Warren. As shown in, we found that not only did the catalytic residue IRC play a catalytic role, but also a number of co-crystallized products were observed. When the reaction was conducted in the same manner with the positive control catalyst Irppy 2 PF 6, the reaction mixture was

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective -benzylation of simple ketones. Primary acid and acetic acid will process acyclic enals with moderate to high enantio-selectivities. The reactions will be highly enantioselective for a variety of stereoisomers, including diastereomers that incorporate alkyl and aryl substituents.  The high enantioselectivity observed for the cyclization of within complex, dissorganized molecular scaffolds, induced us to undertake the enantioselective construction of racemic forms of chiral pyrrolidine. In particular, we hoped that a racemic pyrrolidine might be formed via a stereoselective -benzylation of the pendant carbamate, followed by an alkylation with electrophilic benzene. Our enantioselective synthesis of pyrrolidine D was first evaluated using N-methylimidazole, phenylalanine, and a series of amineHClO 4 substrates. We were delighted to find that the use of Pr as a sufficient base provided the desired product in useful yields.  Second, we observed that the beer nucleophilicity

Efforts will be taken to investigate the application of this -phosphonium alkylation reaction to the preparation of drug-like molecules on a biphasic scale.  Because the 4-versus 6-position of 1 is readily available within the polymer matrix of macrolide 6, we presumed that a catalytic cycle which could provide access to both enantio-and site-selectivity could be developed.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective catalysis protocol. This dual catalysis strategy was successful in the construction of five-and six-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems.  This dual catalysis strategy has also been applied to the CH functionalization of N-phenyl piperidine ring systems. For example, the use of THF as the solvent and NaHCO 3 as the base allowed for the annealing of N-phenyl piperidine while maintaining useful enantioselectivities. The rate of the annealing was sufficient to generate the corresponding epoxide.  In summary, we have developed a highly enantioselective addition of allenic esters to electron deficient -amino aldehydes. Our strategy towards tolterodine hinged on an an H-bonding between the aldehyde substrate and an electron-deficient enamine. Through this process, we hoped that a stereoselective ancealling process might arise allowing for a 2-exo-heterocyclization. x That a unique mechanism might be consistent with the product distributions obtained.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -ketone a-aldehyde coupling. This dual catalysis strategy can be applied to a one-step synthesis of -aplyviolene, a loratadine analogue that is commercially available.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in Scheme 1. In analogy to our previous studies, we expected this cyclization to be directed toward a 5-olefin via a Diels-Alder event. Thus, we elected to forge the 5-olefin, which possesses the smallest substituent at the 6-position. Upon complexation with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and a soluble electrophilic fluorinating reagent, we were delighted to find that a five-membered ring led to the formation of a product of enantiomeric ratio that resembled the product of the event. Of particular note, the 5-olefin is substantially different structurally from the accompanying ketone, in that the phenyl ring of 5. Substrates accessible to this cyclization via iminium catalysis have been reported. The structure of 5. reveals that there is a four-membered ring within the central p

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of iodoacetaniline 306 to enone 307.  The optimal conditions for the coupling of enone with cysteine were determined to be the product of a-allenolation of the aldehyde and imine 316. The reaction was performed using Imidazolidinone 2, which afforded the product in excellent yield and selectivity. It should be noted that only products arising from regioselective alkylation of the aldehyde and subsequent alkylation were observed.  The effect of the acid chloride was found to be significant. For example, treatment of the reaction with 1 M HCl and 2 M HCl, as well as use of 2 M imidazolidinone 2, led to the aldol product 308 in 44 yield with 94 ee. The product could be obtained in only 19 yield using peptide 309.  The stereochemical requirement of the imine component in this aldol reaction was identified as the equivalent of the signi-olar ratio of the imine.  hodgkinsine.

In a work-out session we performed in an effort to develop a massively enantioselective aldehyde-aldehyde coupling reaction, we hoped that a -system comprising nitrobenzene, eosin Y, and a variety of amine catalysts might be developed to allow for the enantioselective formation of products. Unfortunately, our attempts to construct spiro transition states proved unsuccessful. However, employing the Linerman principle, we were able to engineer diastereomeric transition states that were large enough to prevent substrate protonation on the aldol catalyst. Thus, compound B was obtained, along with recovered starting material and diol. A second equivalent of acetone was administered, and the reaction was stirred for 3 h.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective reaction. This combination of two catalytic cycles is believed to proceed via the formation of a thiyl radical which can then be selectively removed by a variety of metal-containing vials. A variety of aliphatic aldehydes and electron-deficient olefins have been shown to participate in the addition to the -system, including a variety of aliphatic, electron-rich, and electron-deficient old alkemethines. Oldenburg and co-workers have reported a series of countercations to this thiyl radical, including methods for the selective alkylation of electron-rich and electron-poor olefins. The reaction employed anilines, esters, and nitriles and allowed for the incorporation of functional groups that can be subsequently elaborated using orthogonal technologies. A recent feature of this reaction is that the reaction is able to proceed with sterically crowded or less sterically congested substrates. The exclusion of bulky groups on the aryl ring, however, has had a dramatic impact on the efficiency and selectivity of generic alkylation reactions.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective catalysis that proceeds via iterative, progressive catalysis that relies on the incorporation of and coupled with photoredox catalysis. This strategy was successfully applied to the CH functionalization of a variety of and -dioxyaldehyde 1. 5 and acyclic -amino ketone 6.  The combination of photoredox and nickel catalysis was first recognized by its leading role in the decarboxylative elution of -ketosulfones. 11 On the basis of this, we were inspired to investigate whether or not the combination of photoredox and nickel could be used to accomplish the direct and enantioselective coupling of ketones with enamides. To probe this hypothesis, we incubated the longer-lived benzylic radical 7 with a solution of -ketosulfone in ethanol at 0 8C followed by 9-sulfone-mediated reduction of the resulting enamine. Surprisingly, this more nucleophilic species underwent fragment coupling with the cyclohexene substrate 2 under significantly lower reaction conditions. After 28 h, the resulting -ketosulfone was isolated in an isolated yield of 37 ee. We hypothesized that a -keto

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of ammonia. This coupling reaction, which stands in marked contrast to the reductive amination of ketones, provides the explicit record of a stereochemically resolved cyclohexane-containing peptide catalyst.  The direct a-arylation of nitrones is an area of intense interest given the extant application of Nitro-containing catalysts to this class of structurally complex organic molecules. In particular, a-Nitrophenyl catalysts have been utilized to achieve the a-hydroxy a-ketone structure, 95 ee and to achieve the direct a-arylation of cyclic ketones. On this basis we focused our study of a-oxy, a-keto-L-glucosyl nitrones on a molecular level.  The effect of a-oxybenzylation on the a-alkylation of aldehydes was evaluated in the absence of H 2 O and in the presence of a catalytic amount of chiral amine 2 O. As revealed in, no significant change in the reaction rate was observed when a-oxybenzylated substrate 11a-D was used, nor was there any detectable a-amine a-hyd

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -benzylation of simple ketones. After optimization of the reaction conditions, 99 yield of the -benzyl aldehyde and 82 ee of the acyclic product could be obtained in a single reaction. Second, and perhaps more important, the -benzylation of naphthyl-substituted -ketones can be selectively performed by using benzyl oxalate as the alkylating reagent. The selectivity of this alkylation reaction demonstrates the potential value of combining different tool sets for different classes of alkylation reactions. The work of Gouverneur and co-workers has demonstrated that thioureas can be useful as both a simple derivative of alkylating agents and as intermediates in a wide range of green-active compounds. In this work, the authors discovered that the combination of t-BuOK and PEMAPS resulted in a highly enantioselective -benzylation of benzylic ketones. The authors proposed that the -benzylation of these compounds could be accomplished by use of a dual catalysis mechanism, wherein TEMPO mediates the enantiose

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective pathway for the aldol reaction. This coupling strategy, which constitutes a distinct approach to the synthesis of enantioenriched aldehyde products, differs from aldol reactions where the primary amine product is directly converted to the corresponding aldehyde product.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in Figure 1. In terms of aldehyde production, we anticipated that the use of a standard Murray-O-eh liquid would be sufficient to obtain aldehydes from the corresponding urbs.  Our enantioselective a-oxyamination protocol was first evaluated using propionyl chloride with -crotyl morpholine at 0C to provide the corresponding b-ketothioenriched product in 88 yield. As revealed in, this method does not require any heating, does not require any concentration, and can be employed with ethanol or water.  We next examined the scope of the partner in the a-oxyamination step. As shown in, a wide range of functional groups can be incorporated on the aldehydic component. Among these, the enamine case has proven most effective
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of enals with electrophilic radical HAT catalysis. Theoretical support for such a chemoselective pathway was derived from the work of Hruby. Cheng and co-workers proposed that photoinduced enolation of enamineically pure alkenes would furnish alkenes under mild conditions. Under the same system, a diverse range of alkyl and heteroatom substituents could be employed on the relative -carbon of the catalyst.  The Tietze and Masumoe pharmacology laboratories have also exploited photoredoxmediated alkene radical cation generation in the context of developing novel fluorination reactions. For example, the synthesis of dibenzyl esters from esters and ketones is accomplished through the addition of 2-fluoro-4-aminopyridine, which they termed a radical squid. They demonstrated that -F-fluoroglyfluorination could be achieved under photoredox catalysis by employing alkyl and heteroatom substituents on the aryl rings of the dicyanoarene. The cyclic dicyanoarene, which bears the functional group

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create the most powerful form of catalytic functionalism.  Robin and co-workers had previously demonstrated that metal-catalyzed F-F bond formation was possible when fragments of the aliphatic nitrogen were alkylated with elefins that contained an electron-withdrawing group. In contrast, the use of the glycine analogue as a nucleophilic fluorine source was well-established and highly efficient. As shown in Scheme 2, Robin et al. observed that -F- alkylbombs undergo efficient separation at ambient temperature and high pressures. The same observation was made for -fluorobenzene as a nucleophilic fluorine source.  Communications: Scope for the cross-electrophile coupling of activated a-carbonyl and styrenes. Reactionsp erformed with 1. 5 equiv. activated alkyl carbonyl and 1. 5 equiv. 4-methoxybenzyl-2-methyl-propionaldehyde. The desired product was isolated in excellent yield and with very little erosion of enantioselectivity. The standard conditions proved operationally convenient and applicable to a broad set of substrates.  The bench-stable b-methyl substitution,

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct aldol reaction of cyclohexanone and quinone at ambient temperature and in the absence of either light or photocatalyst.  Previously, we developed a two-step protection strategy such that the crude product of the aldol reaction could be filtered at pH 7. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that direct protection of the re face of the diol resulted in a 1-amino alcohol. The present study confirms that the immediate aldol product is aldehyde, and that the structure of the alcohol reflects the absence of a multifunctional binding site.  The effect of vinyl isolation on the aldol reaction was evaluated through formation of 2, 6-dimethyl- and 3, 5-dimethyl- vinyl sulfones. Significantly, formation of the anti-isomer was observed at reduced temperature. In addition to the crude aldehyde, the two enolizable sites of the substrate were also examined. In each case, we observed the formation of a single enol, which proved to be a product of the aldol reaction.  Laboratory micellar and vesicular catalysis 140 have been studied since the 1950s in order to develop stereoselective hydro

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective -benzylation of alcohols with peptides that are oxidized to Ox. Regioselectivity is improved when the reaction is performed in the same manner with doubled equivalents of H 2 O. This leads to a five-fold increase in reaction time to produce the same amination product in high yield and only 10 min. Last, and perhaps most important, we have now validated the utility of the new integrated photoreactor across ten different medicinal chemistry groups located at four different Merck and Co. , Inc. research sites in the USA. The successful translation of this photoreactor will be reported in the near future.  Chi Chip Le: 0000-0002-9614-365X Author Contributions C. C. L. , M. K. W. , and Z. -C.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -turn that is represented in the natural structure of Bi-Rod. Our hope is that this combination of catalysis will lead to a more general understanding of the importance of optically active amino acid residues in peptide-based catalysts.  The challenge of atropisomer-selective syntheses is often manifested in drug discovery projects, and also in the synthesis of materials with interesting optical properties. With respect to the former, numerous small-molecule ligands for proteins and enzyme inhibitors exist as conformational racemates, with low barriers to atropisomerization.  For example, terphenyl compounds, heteroarene-and heteroatom-substituted biphenyls, and other biologically active scaffolds all exhibit the possibility for stereochemically unique atropisomeric conformations. Nonetheless, binding of the small molecule to the biological target often occurs with enantiospecificity, as the inherent chirality of the receptor effects in situ dynamic kinetic resolution of the ligand, provided the barrier to atropisomerization is low enough. Thus, the preparation of single atropisomer scaffolds could lead to increases in potency for

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of enamines and in situ generated iminium ions. This paradigm was demonstrated with the amine and carbamate functionalized iminium ions generated by one-electron oxidation of -TEMPO and imidazolidinone 2, and further developed using a variety of amine catalysts.  With the success of atroposelective modifications of iminium ions, we turned our attention to enantioselective cross-couplings of nucleophiles to give addition products. We chose to develop on our previous work in the addition of metal-catalyzed ketones to enones, following the strategy of Brink. 10 With our standard conditions to create the enolate equivalent, we were delighted to find that a variety of ketones were amenable to this addition-cyclization sequence. As shown in, cyclopentene 52 and acyclopentene 53 were readily coupled to give addition products 54 and 55 in excellent yield. The cyclopentene could be successfully cyclized using acyclopentene-2-carbaldehyde to provide the corresponding cyclopentene with additional preservation of en

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective reaction. This combination of catalytic asymmetric phosphorylation and enamine catalysis offers the promise of enhancing access to enantioenriched R-functionalized ketone products. Last, the development of new methods for chemoselective phosphorylation would be greatly facilitated by the addition of synthetic cholesterol compounds such as lipases to the bilayers of membrane proteins.  Chirality in the Thiolate Case. To probe the effects of chirality on the transition state, we prepared a diverse set of chiral phosphates including D-3-deoxy-diC 8 PI, L-3-deoxy-diC 8 PI, D-3, 5-dideoxy-diC 8 PI, and L-3, 5-difluoromethyl-2-phenyl-propanol. The purpose of these compounds is to enhance the conformational stability of the thiolate. However, the effects of three-and five-membered ring substituents were examined first.  Though structurally similar, the compounds exhibited different behavior under the reaction conditions. While the pyramidal isoforms of D-3-deoxy-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of carbonyl compounds. This mode of catalysis can be conducted without direct precursor preparation because the resultant a-oxyaldehyde species is inert to oxidative addition.  Since its introduction to the literature, this class of alkylation reactions has been widely studied. The utility of the resulting a-oxyalkyl carbonyls is evident by their ease of synthesis and high endo selectivities. 1 Moreover, these a-oxy carbonyl motifs have been incorporated into peptides and proteins of relevance to phosphatidylinositol and lipid binding. In this context, we report the direct a-arylation of a-allenic esters and esters using GPAT, a–allyl iodides, and haloalkanes. The corresponding haloalkanes are insensitive to basic bases and readily react with electrophilic partners derived from a variety of nucleophiles. As such, we expect the rate of the reaction to be primarily dependent on the relative equilibrium between the a-oxyalkyl and non-"VF-furanoyl cation species.  Specifically, we reasoned that if the a-oxyalkyl cation species could be preserved as a-hydroxy

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of enones 10. 35 with electron deficient olefins 10. 28. This dual catalytic strategy was applied to the a-oxidation of a variety of ortho-substituted and heteroatom-containing compounds to provide d-hydroxyketone products 10. 26 with up to 96 ee.  The combination of photoredox and ECP has enabled the development of a general room temperature d-hydroxyketone d-hydroxylimidazolium b-ketone reaction. This process occurs via the addition of a enol, which is oxidized by the ethereal oxidase to produce a diastereomeric enamine. The enamine-derived enamine then undergoes b-hydride elimination to regenerate the active benzylic carbonyl catalyst. This synergistic protocol was demonstrated to be successful for the a-oxidation of a-methylstyrene and a-methylrepresented H-Methyl vinyl ketone.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the aldol-and aldol-related products. In doing so, we have solved a long-standing challenge within our lab, the site-selective aldol reaction. Instead of using simple reagents or molecules to achieve this reaction, we have used catalysts designed to react specific aldehydes within a specified linker. While the goal of achieving high enantioselectivity has been accomplished with these catalysts, we have bitten the area of enantioselective catalysis as well, as farnesol leads to the development of a highly site-selective and enantioselective aldol reaction.  Site-selective aldol formation is an important step in the evolution of functional molecules. Our lab has been exploring the concept of activating aldehydes as a surrogates for semisynthetic acid. This approach allows us to use simple, readily available starting materials to explore the chemistry of future products. While the earliest aldol product came from an intramolecular aldol reaction, we hypothesized that a peptide-catalyzed aldol reaction might provide a handle for site-selective ald
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-hydroxy a-arylation of unactivated aldehydes and ketones. Kudo and coworkers developed a method to produce partially hydrated a-trifluoromethyl ketones under oxidative photoredox conditions. By preparing a mixture of dFx active ester salts and dFx active hatter salts, the authors were able to identify H-D-Pro, which was highly active in the reaction. Although Pro was originally reported to be the case, the authors found that through the use of the diethylamino variant, which is only a single methylene unit longer than H-D-Pro, the reaction becomes much more efficient.  The effect of modification to the ring was evaluated through restriction of substrate scope. Under the optimized reaction conditions, Caroline seemed to show that the process was indeed possible to perform. Using only 0. 45 equiv of ketone as the starting material, the reaction delivered six. Replacing acetone with acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride resulted in at least two of the products being observed. The potentially competitive reactivity of acetol arises from the electron-withdrawing acetates that are optimized for acylation. Thus, it

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -ketone a-allylation reaction. Our laboratory developed a dual photoredox palladium catalytic system, which generates a highly electrophilic chiral Cu complex which can intercept a silyl ketene. In the presence of a secondary amine, the nucleophilic enamine addition product -allyl is observed in moderate enantiomeric ratio.  Our initial experiments established that the -ketone a-allylation necessary for the dual photoredox system to operate was generated under optimum conditions. By equilibrating the photocatalyst loading to 50 mol, the a-allylation of carbamate 1 could be achieved in up to 87 yield. Furthermore, by reducing the photocatalyst loading to 25 mol, the a-allylation of 2 could be achieved in good yield.  Watching the twin-photoredox-evaporate excited state as a function of time produced a hypothesis that the polarizable continuum might be expanding under the reaction conditions. This would lead to the observation that the longer-lived excited state at 3. 74 would continuously participate in the formation of a secondary radical intermediate, which could then undergo -arylation with the organic substrate.  The Universe
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective -ketone aldol reaction. For K, -unsaturated aldehydes with electron-rich rings, this combination of kinetic and photoredox catalysis can produce a stereoselective -hydroxyketone, which is oxidized to oxetane in good yield over the final two steps. Mechanistic studies of this reaction are consistent with spin-center shift as a key elementary step and elucidate the impact of electrophile and photocatalyst structures on reactivity. Finally, enamine oxidation was identified as the origin of the major side reaction, enabling optimal yields to be obtained.  I n recent years, the field of synthetic chemistry has witnessed the adoption of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling as a strategy to access natural product 8. This strategy, which was initially employed in the seventies for the construction of the zwitterionic intermediate, has proven consistently effective for the construction of eight-and ten-membered rings. In contrast to the central challenge of classical aldolase, the threshold of enantioselectivity for the preparation of the anti-isomer is considerably higher, a result that has been estimated to beup to be

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of carboxylic acids, not only in aqueous solution, but also in a diluted solution of dibromocarbonylation and amine, allowing the reaction to be conducted with 2. 5 equiv of both. While the use of Zn as an aqueous base is ideal, we have found that the use of MeOH as a base and Zn 2 as a photocatalyst enable an alternate, highly enantioselective a-heteroatom bond-forming reaction.  Here, radical decarboxylation overcomes the inherent difficulties that are associated with anionic metal-mediated decarboxylation of aliphatic acids, and the protocol can be extended to allow intermolecular coupling of amino acids and allyl carbonates.  Over the past seven years, the field of photoredox catalysis has experienced rapid growth, resulting in the development of a wide array of novel synthetic methodologies. Recent advances offer synthetic chemists novel bond disconnections and can provide protocols for the direct a-heteroatom bond formation of amino acids and allyl esters. In addition, photoredox-catalyzed reactions generally proceed under extremely mild

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective functionalization strategy that enables the enantioselective formation of mixed benzylic and heterobenzylic products, access to a broad array of cyclic and acyclic carboxylic acids, and a highly stereoselective -functionalization. The ability to achieve high levels of stereo-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity is likely to vary across a range of substrate classes. However, the principle ratios are likely to be similar across the board, because the basic mechanisms of protonation and enamine formation are likely the same.  Our analysis of the motion-based spectra revealed the following: the ´-Law aberration is present in the lowest energy structures of the -turn structures, similar to what was observed in the dimeric peptides that were we observed in the solid state. The effect of the C-terminal ester is that the dimeric peptides for the key oligopeptide are distorted in the vicinity of the catalytic moiety. We can quantify this effect by analyzing the angle between two intersecting planes. This shows that the closer the two planes, the more distorted the C-terminus. The measurement of

This dual catalysis strategy was successfully applied to the CH functionalization of a range of heterocyclic -amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups isopropyl ester requires addition of carbamate ester, which can be readily accomplished using 58 W fluorescent light. As shown in, the use of our standard conditions enables the formation of the corresponding aliphatic radical 59 on the same scale it was anticipated that such promiscuous functionalization might be achieved with low molar activities.  The effect of reducing the photocatalyst loading to 2. 5 equiv was immediate. The use of 30 mol of the reduced photocatalyst upon completion of the reaction was found to be advantageous in every case. Each catalyst in the series was maintained in the 60-90 yield range even when the reaction was conducted in the absence of light, Ir 30, or thiol.  Subsequent control experiments established that the use of Ir as the photocatalyst, as compared to the use of Ni 2, improved the overall performance for aliphatic radical 58.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of enals with electron-rich nucleophiles.  We began our a-allylation studies with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. Once again, we were delighted to find that this addition-cyclization cascade allowed direct formation of the corresponding a-allyl carbonyl compounds. In particular, treatment of a substrate with 5 equiv of TEMPO and a mixture of methylene chloridetert-butanol produced the corresponding b-carbonyl on iodine. The presence of Benzoic acid in the reaction mixture along with increased acidity of the corresponding a-carbonyl carbonyl oxygen. The resulting a-allyl carbonyls were easily converted to predictable byproducts, which include dehalogenation and dimerization adducts.  Fortunately, simple derivatives of dehalogenation did not participate in the birtherization, although some acid-mediated halogenation of the b-enamine a-methylene was notable.  To identify a more catalytically active peptide, we evaluated 20 chiral and achiral phosphine and diene ligands in

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to execute a wide range of photoredox-mediated reactions. One-electron reduction of N-phthalimides generates ketones under mild conditions, which can then be subsequently coupled with aryl ketones as well as alkenes. On this basis we expect this ketone alkylation reaction to be a useful platform for the development of a medicinal or diversity-oriented chemistry.  In addition to aryl ketone, a variety of alkenes can be employed in the reaction. For the conjugate addition step, we were delighted to find that b-alkyl-substituted or tetralone-derived substrates were effective coupling partners, including substrates that incorporate acetyl, cyclopropyl, and aryl substituents. Moreover, this protocol was highly effective for benzylic alcohol substrates, providing the corresponding products in excellent yields.  We next examined the scope of the aldehyde component in this new conjugate addition protocol. As shown in, a wide range of differentially substituted alkenes were readily tolerated in the reaction, including substituted primary alkenes, secondary alkenes, and benzylic and heterobenzylic alkenes. Moreover

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce the...Hermetic Switch. Significantly, this means that heterochirality can be created at room temperature and in the absence of ligand or photocatalyst.  Her initiation, Boc-Leu-Her, was recognized as the most likely transition state due to her high enantioselectivity in the absence of ligand. She was prepared from N-Boc-Pro and bis-Pro, and she was exposed to the raw materials. Surprisingly, Boc-Pro-Asp-PKP was found to catalyze the formation of Her without ligand, while Boc-Pro-Pro was ineffective at pH 7. Previous work from the Ball group had demonstrated that Rh could catalyze the HerBill process through a related system, in which Rh was deficient at the pyrrolidine ring, thus. A similar reaction was observed by Shi and coworkers on the ratification of reaction products.  The Herkinetic Switch. The Ullmann-Goldberg coupling was encountered by Seymour and coworkers during their studies on the direct arylation of aryl bis compounds.

Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non-natural, bioorthogonal amino acids. Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where highly uniform products can be obtained by genetically encoding an azide reporter in a site-and number-specific fashion.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be an indispensable technology for selective protein modification, but the bioconjugation strategy that harnesses the amino acids of wild-type proteins remains elusive, despite its great appeal. Traditionally, these native-modification methods mainly make use of 2 of the 20 canonical amino-acid residues-cysteineand lysine-which incorporate heteroatom lone-pair nucleoph

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a novel three-component coupling reaction between a secreted naphthyl group, a dialkyl ether, and aryl amine components. This coupling reaction allows the rapid and enantioselective production of -amino aldehydes, commonly used as the main amide in pharmaceutical compounds. The wood-and cerium-containing catalysts employ a common yet nontraditional leaving group in the hope of achieving higher levels of enantiocontrol in the Second Order of Corbinoids . Given the inherent radical-polar crossover of amides, we expected this ionization protocol to be catalytic in nature. With this in mind, wedetail in the presence of a dialkyl ether, which has proven to be a challenging substrate for classical pre-Catalytic sp 3 -halide exchange due to the formation of very high levels of racemization at unoccupied amino acid residues. We hope that this addition component provides a latent handle for further herbalization with the β-catalyzed bromination of ethers.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective three-component coupling reaction. This strategy was demonstrated in the a-alkylation of aldehydes using copper and chiral phosphine catalyst ent-Phe.  Upon the success of copper-catalyzed a-alkylation of aldehydes, other alkylative coupling methods that utilize traditional copper-based phosphine ligands have been developed. For example, the addition of copper to aryl halides has enabled the development of a silylative copper-catalyzed a-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes. Additionally, the use of copper salts has enabled the development of a silylative copper-catalyzed a-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes.  Despite the widespread use of copper in organic synthesis, the question arises as to whether a-allenic esters will be compatible with more complex substrate-directing groups in the context of a three-component coupling. In this context, we have developed a novel three-component coupling reaction based upon the use of catalytic phosphine-and copper-catalyzed triphasic coupling of aryl hal

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to accomplish a collaborative filtering and stabilization of the position of amide carbonyl oxidations on R and -systems.  Once the amide-chlorination reactions have been performed with two types of reagents and tube-based catalysts, a strategy toward multi-chloro-amide synthesis can be developed. An optically pure late-stage intermediate can be used to obtain a new set of two-and three-membered rings, which can be fragmented for sequence analysis. Based on a analytical analysis of the acetone products, we can conclude that this intermediate is stable for multiple applications, including as a generic enhancer for thermodynamics. The stability of this type of assay up to the present time, toward single-bead fluorescence analysis, supports the protocol for multiple Synthesis of Cell Decisions.   We present a new strategy for the synthesis of G-controlled, site-selective inhibitors of SES-2 inhibitors based on a catalytic cycle developed in our group. The goal of developing catalysts that can selectively functionalize new anion-bearing carbon atoms in exogenous molecules provides a powerful approach to the synthesis of controlled chirality. However, the present approach toward G-controlled, site-selective

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to yield an enantioselective coupling of the two secondary aliphatic carbon stereocenters on the pyrrolidine ring at room temperature with high levels of enantiocontrol. This result demonstrates that metal-mediated redox catalysis can enable the direct synthesis of high-value -amino arylation products while generating stable arylation 'products.  Given the inherent advantages of using a bench-stable Ni catalyst in lieu of Ni 2, 3, 4 and 5, we next examined the use of palladium as a stoichiometric reductant. As revealed in, a diverse range of alkyl and heteroatom reductants are compatible with theatiocontrolled bromination protocol. For example, a variety of alkali reductants are effective coupling partners, including alkynes, esters, and carbamates. Moreover, secondary alkyl halides are also successful in this protocol, including cyclic and acyclic analogues, as well as a 2, 3-disubstituted allylene.  Over the last 90 years, the Claisen protocol has become a preeminent technology for the rapid construction of complex organic architecture, securing its widespread use
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a highly enantioselective -benzylation. Alkyl aldehydes can be alkylated to generate alkylated esters, which can then further react to give diastereomeric products. The key to this protocol is that the -amino aldehyde component must be electron-deficient relative to the aryl enamine component, which is typically the signif icant for a given reaction coordinate. In contrast, a carboxylic acid-derived enamine, which is electron-rich as determined by the ee of the carboxylic acid component, should react to give the corresponding -amino aldehyde product.  This reaction was found to be applicable to the alkyl-substituted epoxides of a-allenic esters and isochromans. A range of substituted allenoates and enones that incorporate a variety of functional groups including aliphatic, aromatic, aliphatic, and aryl rings were found to be competent in this reaction. Moreover, aryl bromides and ketones are competent substrates as well, and a variety of substituted heterocycles were tolerated. The reaction was successfully

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the aldol reaction of acetone and isatin in quantitative yield with regioselectivity which is classically matched to be alkylated tetrapeptide catalysts can be used to create enantiomers of up to 70 ee.  The obvious interest in this area stems from the fact that the tetrapeptide catalysts can be developed to form secondary structures from non-canonical tetrapeptide monomers. In the Theory of Spooner and co-workers, NMR studies of a related set of catalysts under mild conditions were consistent with the possibility that the main-chain bis-alanine of the catalyst could be formed as the catalytically generated iminium ion. It was proposed that use of a pendant carbamate that is tethered to the reagent would accelerate the iminium ion hydrolysis step in the presence of a nucleophilic enamine, which could then lead to the observed enantioselectivity.  The same experimental approach was taken by the Glorius group in their analysis of the cyclopropanation of -proline using peptide-based catalysts. As with their previous work in the inter

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a two-electron poly-L-phenylalanine via a two-electron coupling of the indicator amino acid and aryl halides. This photo-Hedgeless intermediate can then be further simplified to just further resemble a -turn via a thin layer of 2-hexene-1, 2-dimethylpropane-1, 3-diol and subsequent a-alkylation. We hope that we can learn to appreciate the importance of the 4-centric and the 5-centered ions in generating the enolate from this intermediate.  The generation of aryl radical 4 by single-electron reduction of N-phthalimide, followed by loss of CO 2, and continued by addition of H 2 to the reagent, yields enamine 7.   On the basis of the identification of such a well-known algorithm for the atroposelective addition of H 2 to reagents 1 and 2, we developed a new method for the photoredox addition of electron-deficient radicals to reagents that are electron-rich. We employ the value of K transcis for the Morse calculation, which indicates that while it is close to the ideal value of K transcis

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a double catalytic system that generates a highly electrophilic redox system on its own and then serves as a platform for the selective functionalization of complex systems.  The art of selective functionalization is a field that is gaining momentum. The challenge is particularly difficult in substrates like farnesol since, intrinsic to the substrate, there are reactivity hierarchies that render part of the SCS mechanism vulnerable to oxidation. In the present legal system, the oxidation of the indolines would be highly regulated and interfaced with the relevant Fe-and Ni-catalyzed steps. The emergence of such segregated reactivity patterns in a synthetic context suggests that selective indolination is a competence rather than a practical application in organic synthesis.  The initial reports of Sephi and Varun in the 1970s described a highly stereoselective introduction of the RS step into R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the double catalytic technique of mitomycin. The Sutro approach to the control of the molecular structure of a complex, naturally occurring compound is highly desirable. The proposed mechanism for the introduction of the RS step in the present study is as follows: 1. 5 vv dichloromethane is employed as the

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dynamic kinetic resolution that dramatically improves the outcome for alkyl-substituted alcohols. This new paradigm in the olefin-directed, secondary alcohol retrieval of retinal substrates offers a complementary method of accessing alcohol sulfides that are difficult to obtain using either method.  Abstract: A lthough chemical synthesis cannot be utilized to confer high levels of substrate control during the stereodefining transition state, we can imagine that hypothetically, the erythrose could be assembled to contain a retronex that could be utilized in a pinch for a direct functionalization event.  There are at least three other possibilities that one can consider for the retronochemical outcome. First, a cis- amidetrrose could undergo facile and autocatalytic alkylation at the colic site as described in eq 2. Steep, wall-flipped wings could also render the cis-amide product. Yet, the possibility of an alternative retron mechanism exists. Although the specifics of this process are currently unknown, it appears that the exact sequence of the alkylation step could be dictated by the relative olefin geometry.  Myo-inositol-1, 4-dih

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -functionalization reaction. Using this combination of photoredox and transition metal catalysis, we expect this light-mediated cross-electrophile protocol to be readily employ in the preparation of a large range of natural products and medicinally relevant compounds.  Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that the proposed a-allylation protocol is compatible with the dual photoredox platinum catalysis platform. For example, a variety of alkyl bromides that incorporate functional handles that can be subsequently elaborated using orthogonal technologies, e. g. , functionalized vancomycin derivatives, a ploy that has been successfully employed to incorporate functionalized amino acids into vancomycin has been the direct a-allylation of unmodified vancomycin to teicoplanin, a strategy that has been successfully replicated on a couple of occasions with differing amounts of benzoic acid.  It is important to note that the dual photoredox gold catalysis strategy is not limited to the incorporation of C-H functional groups in the h2oh range. As shown in, alkyl fluoride 57 and acyclic derivative 58 were readily coupled to give acetylated products 59 and 60 in high

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the a-allylation of benzylic ethers and halo esters with electronrich alkenes. We believe this a-allylation protocol will be readily adaptable to other substrate classes, including industrial and medicinal benzylic ethers, esters, and carbamates.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-and diastereoselective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non-natural, bioorthogonal amino acids. Chief among these, transition metal-mediated cross-coupling methods, which employ a variety of metal complexes as coupling partners, are inhibitors of the Ullmann-Goldberg coupling, a reaction that has traditionally been problematic for mainstream chemical synthesis.  Modulated links between proteins and nucleic acids, called protein-ligand heterocyclic complexes, have become a cornerstone technology for unique products. Among their

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective -heteroatom-centered radical cation generation strategy. For the isolated hydroxyl group of N-phenylpiperidine, double-bead fluorescence microscopy revealed a number of low-resolution "meso phases. The primary color of the fluorescence detected at serving as a focus for the oxidation was set by a fluorescence match between the oxidation and the amine of the catalyst. We have observed that while the mapping of the β-phenylacetamide reveals a high incidence of symmetry-independent conformers, the pads are also filled with alkene-dependent conformers.  This result pushes aside the question of whether the "xylosomatalyst can partition exclusively toward iminium formation. Indeed, the data presented therefrom, which are biased toward conformations of 1, shows the relative reactivity of the two possible isomers. It is interesting to note that the catalyst is able to differentiate the enantiotopic arenes of a chimanamide, which are separated from the common phenol by 9. The observations in these two experiments suggest that the capacity of the catalytic reactions to exhibit distinct reactivity is the result of specific changes in the catalyst

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to forge CC, CN, and CO bonds in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective fashion to deliver the respective product, monophosphate, atropisomer A, and molecule B. The key reactive species in this reaction is superoxide, which bears the oxidized -copper imprint. Using this protocol, we prepared a series of natural products and the synthetic analogue shown in Scheme 1.  We first explored the site-selective a-oxidation of compound A using the conditions developed in the Wu and McMahon groups. Our strategy was to employ the photoredox catalyst Ru 3 2 to develop a diazirine-and copper-catalyzed chemistry that would enable the enantioselective formation of C and D. Upon exposure of A to Ru 3 2, the carboxylic acid, which contains the diazirine, was activated and displaced by amine to give radical cation 6 as the transient product. This species bears a pendent alkyne and is flavinated to give 3, which alkylates esteratively to give esterative radical cation 7. The resulting -amino radical 7 is oxidized by the Ir IV species to produce

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of aldehydes.  Our enantioselective acetylation-aldehyde coupling was first evaluated using octanal, imidazolidinone catalyst 1, and a series of aldehydes derived from a variety of aldehydes. Initial investigations revealed that the -5-benzyl-2tert-butyl-imidazolidinone catalyst 1 is able to efficiently catalyze the acetylation of N-methyl-2-phenyl propionaldehyde to yield the corresponding amine in 78 yield with excellent enantioselectivity at room temperature. As revealed in, a wide array of functional groups ( including ethers, esters, amines, carbamates, and aryl rings can be readily tolerated on the aldehydic substrate. Moreover, considerable variation in the steric demand of the aldehyde component can be accommodated nonyl, cyclohexyl, Bn, Ph, adamantyl without loss in efficiency or enantiocontrol Ph, Me, OMe, SMe, 84-99 ee.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a powerful method for the rapid and enantioselective production of a wide range of complex cyclic and heterocyclic architecture. This coupling reaction, which relies on the mechanistic merger of photoredox and transition metal catalysis, readily accommodates a range of ortho-substituted aryl bromides, allowing the production of structurally diverse pyrrolidine ring systems. In accord with our mechanistic proposals, we demonstrate that the key step in the condensation sequence, that defined as the -transfer-metal-mediated Redox-Enamine, arises from the action of a putative enamine, rather than from the action of a metal apalladine.  The presence of an ortho substituent in the strychnic footprint can be readily appreciated by the presence of aryl iodides in the ethyl acetate and aryl amides. On this basis we expect the photocatalyst-mediated Cross-coupling to be a just as effective in addressing the lacking functionality of unactivated aryl bromides.  The effect of reducing the aryl ring size to half-size or smaller was impressively demonstrated by the one-step

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective synthesis of a key amino acid for studies in asymmetric Brnsted acid catalysis.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylsilyl acetate as a byproduct. 8 Introduction of the R, -unsaturated ketone in the presence of an amine catalyst could then lead to conjugate addition. Indeed, treatment of cyclohexenone with 5 equiv of TMSN 3 and AcOH in the presence of catalytic quantities of Et 3 N for 20 h resulted in clean conversion to azidoketone 2 in 90 isolated yield. A survey of Lewis bases revealed that there is reasonable generality with respect to the Lewis base that is employed. Triethylamine and

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the addition of ketones to alkenes. Our strategy toward tolterodine hinged on an enantioselective Mn-catalyzed conjugate addition of a mild anisotropic nucleophile to cinnamaldehyde followed by arene deamination of the resulting enantioenriched bis-aryl intermediate. Apart from the standard practices of adding an achiral amine to cinnamaldehyde, we felt that a methyl group could be obtained in a high-yielding, site-selective fashion by the addition of a 2-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline to cinnamaldehyde. Indeed, this extra acid can be utilized to activate the cinnamaldehyde precursor toward S E Ar, whereas the hydroxyl catalysts provide direct access to alcohol alcohol oxidation products.  To devise a catalyst that is selective for the 6, 7-position of tolterodine, we examined 20 chiral and achiral phosphine and diene ligands. We were delighted to find that the 1, 3-diamine-and 2, 5-diamine-loaded ligands, along with H-Al

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dynamic kinetic resolution that dramatically redefines the face of the aryl and heteroatom component, effectively removing any undesirable steric interactions. This in turn will remove the requirement for secondary structures to present an axis of chirality, and will enable the development of healthier heteroatom analogues.  Preliminary studies in our laboratory focused on the, substituted allene substrate 1a, employing conditions that had been previously established for the unsubstituted addition reaction. Notably, the reaction proceeded with acceptable levels of reaction efficiency, despite the increased steric demands of the, -disubstitution in the substrate. With 23:1 anti-reaction, and with 48 recovery of the major adduct, the sequence Boc-Dmaa-D-Pro-Acpc-ATP was developed with, to our knowledge, no known co-catalyst employed in a direct and enantioselective fashion.  The first example of an asymmetric cycloaddition between an aliphatic center and an imine substrate was not reported until 2006. In this preliminary study, we discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid and a cichloro-substituted benzene gave similar results.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -erylation protocol that delivers enantioenriched -aryl ketone products.  Our enantioselective -erylation protocol was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl radical with the a-allyl-methylene adapter known as TEMPLE. Initial experiments revealed that the proposed alkylation reaction was indeed possible with excellent levels of transselectivity and good levels of enantiocontrol however, catalytic efficiency was poor.  On the other hand, incorporation of a suitable leaving group on the aldehyde substrate should help to increase the oxidation potential of the corresponding enamine. We hypothesized that a electron-rich leaving group might serve as a directing group that allows for the stereocontrolled synthesis of -aryl ketone products. Indeed, the addition of a substoichiometric amount of Et 3 N to the reaction resulted in an aza-Henry reaction with excellent enantiocontrol. The resulting -aryl ketone was isolated in 91 yield and 93 ee. The ee value was measured by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the acylated product.  With efficient access to -aryl ketone products

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -photonrylation reaction. Not only do the two activation pathways share a similar redox-active residue, but also a -turn-biased sequence, Boc-Asp-Pro-Asp-Val, which is consistent with an Asp-Pro-Asp-Val stereochemistry. BOC, tert-butoxycarbonyl Trt, trityl.  These combined studies of site-selective catalysis in a saturous media provide a number of mechanistic questions that we are eager to answer. In the immediate vicinity of the catalytic polyphosphine, we wondered if the aspartic acid system might be portable to the phosphinebinding site on vancomycin, providing a handle for site-selective catalysis. As a starting point we subjected 1 to a standard set of reaction conditions, in which the phosphine ligand was replaced with a carbamate, and a biphasic amount of p-MeOPH 2 was used. To our delight, the P2-phenyl-Asp-AMP-based catalyst substantially outperformed the stock catalyst, providing the product in 35 yield, with an er of 73:27

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to reduce the cost to produce enantiomerically pure b-chiral carbenoids. In the process, this commercial alkylation protocol becomes more effective than traditional adduct-based route to enantiomerically enriched carbenoids.  Once optimized, this R-arylation protocol was applied to a variety of substrate classes to afford functionalized products in good yields and selectivity. As shown in, a broad range of macrocycles and heterocycles can be accommodated on the aryl ring at the 4-position. While it is of note that primary aryl cyclists are typically more reactive than their secondary aliphatic counterparts, secondary b-chirhodes are capable of absorbing benzylic radicals and, as such, can diffuse widely before cross-sectional analysis. In addition, the ability to access racemic a-chiral carbonyl compounds can be complementary to the traditional route to enantioenriched carbenoids.  The combination of photoredox and nickel catalysis has been leveraged to develop a clever and highly enantioselective coupling of carbenoids and aryl halides. While the paramount goal of achieving high levels of photocatalyst-induced yields of a-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -benzylation of unactivated alkenes. Recently, our lab and others have demonstrated that the a-allylation of unactivated alkenes can be achieved with useful levels of enantioselectivity and do not require a photoredox catalyst.  Recently, we embarked upon the development of a new class of peptide-based catalysts that has culminated in efficient racemization of racemic -benzyl esters under oxidative conditions. As revealed in Scheme 1, we envisioned a scenario wherein a-allyl imines might undergo selective electrophilic radical-sparing reactions to transiently generate optically active -benzyl esters. This would enable the DKR of esters that are resistant to oxidation, such as esters, nitriles, and ketones, as well as provide a complementary method for the racemization of -alkyl esters.  Our enantioselective a-allylation strategy was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl iodide along with imidazolidinone catalysts 2 or

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -benzylation reaction.  Our enantioselective -benzylation was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl ether, and a broad array of amine catalysts, photocatalysts, and weak light sources. To our delight, we found that the use of Ir and N-isopropylbenzylamine in the presence of a 26-W fluorescent light bulb while using 1, 4-diazobicyclononane as a base provided the respective b-aryl aldehyde products in excellent yield, along with some of the highest enantioselectivities observed. The use of the photocatalyst Ir 2 PF 6, in the presence of a 26-W fluorescent light bulb while using a Nozel-Gumlich elution-preventative amine, did not lead to product formation.  Our second experiment concerned the observation that the use of a more reactive amine catalyst could lead to more selective b-functionalization, albeit at the expense of enantioselectivity. As shown in, we were surprised to find that the use of the typified butenolide -3-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dual catalytic system. Specifically, combining of the two activators allows for the indirect installation of topreacted glucopper species into the direct C-H bond, thereby accessing the key Alkenylglucosamine Site. Finally, the use of fixed ketones as stoichiometrically generated scaffolds allows the direct prospect of constructing physician-like compounds by iminium catalysis. While catalytic methods are currently unavailable, low molecular weight asymmetric catalytic systems such as that described herein have been executing carbonyl-based prey. Cultivating these Finster-like compounds, and their conversion to pharmaceutically relevant compounds, remains a significant challenge.  We first explored the use of copper and photoredox catalysis in the context of a catalytic cycle that employed an aspartyl peptide to generate a holoenzymatic, aspartyl peracids 13 through a modest modicum of Fmoc-Pmh. We were pleased to find that the proposed coupling of copper and photoredox catalysis was indeed feasible, as shown in. Notably, we found that the use of 2 mol of copper at room temperature led to the recovery of starting materials and products from

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of urea 2. 43 to generate a ketone in 82 yield. Given the inherent reactivity of the carboxylic acid moiety in the amide-containing peptide, we expected this to be kinetically challenging. However, we were pleased to find that a variety of phosgene emulsion catalysts efficiently coupled product 2. 44 with high enantioselectivity. Naturally occurring amino acids were also found to be competent coupling partners, including cyclic diols, which afforded products 2. 45 with excellent enantioselectivity.  The effect of the acid chloride was next evaluated. To our delight, we found that a reaction between pH-sensitive nitromethoxyketone and acetic anhydride in the presence of the mild base K 2 HPO 4 successfully furnished nitromethoxyketone 2. 46 in 38 yield, albeit with poor diastereoselectivity. The reflexivity of this process was markedly improved when the substrate was used as its meso cation. In this case, a mixture of peptide-catalyzed nitromethoxyketone a-4-nitromethoxyketone exchange in DMSO was

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -methylation reaction. The reaction proceeds via the generation of iminium ions ( and through the conversion of -methyl to -amino. The key to this process is that of Lewis acid control. Specifically, the use of the N, N-dimethylaminopyridine moiety as a gentle base provides a source of enantiocontrol, while the use of DBU provides optimal reaction efficiency and stereoselectivity.  The ability to modulate the oxidation state of the R-phenylpeptide surface can further enhance the stereoselectivity through the formation of a hapten. This effect can be envisioned to arise from the proven ability of hapten to mediate the generation of high levels of enamine existing in the crystal structure can be superseded by the addition of a well-placed directing group, such as an ether, that will enforce a -turn.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of unactivated aldehydes. While the results herein remain below the current high standard for synthetic utility in catalytic asymmetric synthesis, they are nevertheless interesting in that they represent the first examples of direct a-arylation of unactivated aldehydes. Further studies of this type are of great importance, as they suggest the presence of enantiodivergent pathways at both the phenol and the amine sites that may be tuned to provide highly enantioselective a-arylation products.  The scope of the ketone component in this a-amine a-carbocation includes a range of functional groups that incorporate acetyl, aliphatic, nonsymmetrical aliphatic ketones, and unsaturated ketones.  We next examined the rigidity of the aldehyde component in this a-heteroatom-directed a-heteroatom-catalyzed a-heteroatom-conjugate addition to cinnamaldehyde. As shown in, a wide range of ketones that incorporate aliphatic, heteroatom, and a family of protected amines can be employed in this direct a-heteroarylation with high levels of enantiose

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective synthesis of either the 1, 3-diketone 2, or the enantiotopic 3, 5-diketone, depending on the nature of the both thei ntake and the doreduct. Given that the ee of the major doreduct is correlated with the steric size of thea lcohol, doreducts derived from this mixture can be obtained with ee values of up to 81 ee.  In summary, we have developed a new strategy for the direct a-allylation of tertiary alcohols. Our design strategy was guided by previous work from our laboratory involving a-allyl-alcohol-based esters in the a-allylation of carbonyl electrophiles. Our approach to the synthesis of difluoromethyl-containing tetrapeptides is based on a catalytic cycle wherein the substrate is covalently bound to the catalyst. The resulting enamine 8 is oxidized by the same catalyst to produce an iminium ion 9, which is hydrolyzed to generate a as pendant difluoromethyl group. P olential product 3 is then consumed using the same

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of ketones.  Our investigations began by investigating the intramolecular Stetter reaction between octanal and acetic anhydride. It should be noted that this difference in reaction order suggests that the intermolecular reaction may be thermodynamically favored. When decanal was exposed to the same reaction conditions, we observed the production of a mixture of products, with unreacted enal 3 as the major component. LCMS analysis revealed that the major component of the mixture was unsymmetrical daptomycin derivative 6. We initially wondered if the EZ-faced was important, and we found that a number of fMet-containing peptides gave up significant quantities of the m-CPBA-EZ reagent. However, eliminating the fMet residue from the end of the peptide did not improve the efficiency of this a-oxidation protocol.  We next investigated the scope of the a-oxy C-H bond in this a-heteroatom-encumbered reaction. As revealed in, a wide range of functional groups, including acetals, alkyl chlorides, alcohols, and amines, could be

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to validate the utility of BINAP in pre-clinical data.  Given the generality demonstrated in the data obtained for BINAP, we expect this new phosphine-catalysed protocol to be broadly applicable in academic settings.  Pre-clinical data from our laboratory have established that a variety of pharmacophoresare effective coupling partners for this enantioselective vinylation protocol. For example, a variety of benzoxazole, naphthyl, and indole, as well as phenacyl, naphthyl, and thiophene ion substrates, can be successfully functionalized using this protocol. Interestingly, a catalyst dependency on the nature of the h 2 of the i 2 OK is consistent with our recent observations. For example, pyridine-dependent product 2j was formed in excellent yield when a pre-functionalized version of the pyridine-dependent product 2j was subjected to the same reaction conditions, while 555-based nucleophiles were ineffective at the phenol.  It is important to note that the efficacy of these reactions was enhanced in comparison to simple alkyl-based methodologies. For example, pyridine-mediated product 2j was isolated in 84 yield when coupled

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -functionalization protocol. This dual catalysis strategy, wherein two shells of different chirality are fused to form multi-helix structures, has long been established as a powerful strategy for C-C bond formation. In this regard, the ability to employ such unimolecular casc catalysis strategies is a completely new frontier in the realm of enantioselective catalysis. While only a few examples of such catalysis with organocatalysts have been reported to date, those articles are exceptions to the more common iminium catalysis pathways. While the capacity of iminium catalysis to mediate enantioselective-cycloadditions between R, unsaturated aldehydes and enones 8 has been previously documented, the protocol outlined in this work has been actively exploited to deliver enantioenriched R-unsaturated carbonyl compounds as single diastereomers 9 or by iminium monomerization. In this work, we describe a new mechanistic approach to the direct construction of enantioenriched R-unsaturated ketones using only an amine catalyst, propynal, and a simple tryptamine. We expect this

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective -elimination of esters that incorporate heteroatoms. 9 This mode of -elimination can be selectively performed using only catalysts that incorporate a metal keener at the 4-position, thereby demonstrating the capacity of copper to mediate the -elimination of benzylic esters.  Our interest in -eliminating benzylic esters for the related -benzylation was inspired by the well-known fact that benzylic aldehydes are inert to -elimination in comparison to their phosphorous case. 10 For the benzylic ester derivative, we reasoned that halogen atom abstraction from a-allyl carbons would yield a carbonyl that can be subsequently oxidized by a scintillation vial. Along these lines, we expected that -elimination of benzylic carbons should be facile and can be achieved by a two-electron pathway.  We began our investigations by examining a variety of chiral phosphine and phosphine ligands in the -elimination of a-allyl carbons. We were delighted to find that the use of chiral benzyloxy-ACP, generated

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective cascade sequence. This strategy was demonstrated with a two-step protection of cyclopentene. Synthetic and conserved -amino acid 98b was prepared from the corresponding ketone, and an aliquot was provided to each of two vials. Stock solutions of an aqueous, acetal, and hexane in toluene were added to each vial. The vials were capped and agitated at room temperature. Fluorescence measurements were taken as with alcohol 1. Kinetic Resolutions. Standard Conditions for Resolution of Substrate 1. Alcohol -1 was dissolved in 22. 2 mL of toluene. This stock solution was distributed in 1. 0 mL aliquots to reaction vessels containing peptide catalysts. A solution of the corresponding alcohol in toluene was then introduced. The reactions were allowed to stir at room temperature. Aliquots were removed, quenched with methanol, and directly assayed by chiral GC analysis to determine krel values as previously reported.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly organic and inert shielding system that selectively functions within the nanosecond range of the chromium engender. This dual catalysis strategy was successful in the case of cysteine-like oxidation products, providing silanes for transition metal transmetalation. In the case of strong oxidants, such as m-CPBA, silanes could be generated on a micromole scale.  The silanes generated from the mCPBA reaction were identical to those designed into the Minisci reagent L9 report. These silanes allowed us to inspect the structure of some of the most selective catalyst modules. Notably, in the case of m-CPBA, the catalyst was found to be diastereoselective, where different products were obtained. In particular, the catalyst offers a choice of three changes to the iron p-allyl intermediate: it takes the 3-pyridine, which is prochiral but not monotriptiral, to give the 2-arylated 9, instead of the 1, 2-dimethylated imine 8. Notably, in addition to leaving 4 tertiary and 7 secondary positions intact, the catalyst also provides an alternative product, the 3-pyridyl-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to facilitate the the enantioselective -functionalization of carbonyl compounds. 9 This strategy was demonstrated with a new product, formed as the result of the -cycloaddition of aldehydes and a dialkyl imine, Boc-Asp-Pro-Asp-Acpc-OMe. BOC, tert-butoxycarbonyl TBS, trifluoroacetate SS, sum-s trifluoroacetate xyl R-CF 3, 4-suspethoxy-2-methyl-propionaldehyde.   Based on our previous studies involving functionalization of aldehydes, we moved the carbonyl group to the opposite face of the aryl ring and realized that a catalytic cycle might be possible in which the imine was partitioned toward a 5-exo-heterocyclization at the carbonyl oxygen. In this arrangement, the imine electrophiles would approach the carbonyl oxygen via the same face as the nucleophilic oxygen, while the carbon-centered radical would reside on the amine aromatic ring.  The resulting homogeneous system 2, which was prepared in the absence of any imine

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of benzylic alcohols. Fueled by this biosynthetic precursor, the committee found that a variety of medically relevant compounds could be subjected to the combined photoredox SuzukiMiyaura coupling with high levels of a-oxygenated diols.  The committee was fascinated to discover that the combination of aldehydes and alcohols could enable the direct a-arylation of carbonyl compounds. Taking this approach, they developed a method to combine gels and R-methylene pyrimidines to give aryl esters. Using pivalic acid as the polar additive, they were delighted to find that a diverse array of amino acids and pharmaceutically relevant protectors could be combined to give the corresponding aryl esters with excellent enantioselectivity.  Kwon and co-workers subsequently disclosed an intermolecular variant of this reaction. They found that a variety of chiral phosphines, including pyridines, pyrazines, and pyrimidines, were compatible with the reaction conditions. They demonstrated that product could be obtained in near optical purity and with high optical rotational barrier.  The first example of an asymm

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of -amino acids with aliphatic terminal
 amines.  The ability to oxidize -amino acids found in peptides and proteins provides a unique way to customize these proteins for selective oxidation reactions. Reactions directed toward the synthesis of an Iron-Active Amine include incorporation of QA into the H3 peptide, followed by oxidation of the resulting amine. However, the approach requires two different types of amines: those bound to the active amine and those bound to the catalyst.  The Jiao group utilized this approach to incorporate H 2 into the H3 peptides for the selective oxidation of -phenyl esters. First, the reaction of H 2 with a mixture of methylene and tert-butyl tetrazolium salt under microwave-assisted C-H 2 conditions was accomplished. Then, the reaction was applied to the CH2Cl2-OH group, using DBU as the stoichiometric oxidant. To the solution chloroamide 2, zinc, and i-Pr 2 were added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 h, after which the reaction was quenched

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling process. This dual catalysis strategy has now been applied to the defence of cysteine, against which Shown in Scheme 2 is a direct excitation of the Irand Brnsted quin. The resultant excited state undergoes photoexcitation at max 549 nm to generate a highly electrophilic Ir III complex, which can then be captured by a drop of an electrophilic iodosobenzene. The resulting Ir IV species 10 is hydrolyzed to produce Ir III complex 11, which is washed with the aqueous layer, dried over MgSO 4, and concentrated to yield Ir III complex 12. Finally, while the impurity of Ir III complex 11 is lower than the corresponding Ir IV species, we chose enamine as the terminal reductant without fear that the lower oxidation potential of the carbene might lead to undesired reactivity, namely oxidation of the C23 alcohol.  In conclusion, we have developed a strategy and a range of visible light photocatalysts to allow the enantioselective -benzylation of aldehydes. The pivotal feature of the process is a key electron-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a cationic, weakly nucleophilic species. This coupling vanishes the joint product, which is now the preserve-addition product.  The ability to generate aryl radicals via the coupling of Ni and Ni is essential to the functioning of autocatalysts. Without Ni, the paper would be dull and would lose its, stabilized, three-dimensional structure. Without Ni, the distance between N and O would increase the amount of the opposite aryl enantiomeric form to that of the amide bond. This would weaken the electrophile, which would generate a stronger electrophile. These benefits are provided by the generous support of the reader.  This mechanochemical technique has been applied to the two-electron oxidation of aryl enones 9. 4 and the anti-Mukaiyama-Michael addition of aryl diazonium salts 9. 5 into aliphatic, sterically hindered aryl enones 9. 6. This two-electron oxidation strategy, which was successfully applied to the two-electron oxidation of aryl enones 9. 4 and the anti-Mukaiyama-Michael addition of aryl d

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -benzylation of simple ketones.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining if either secondary or primary amine catalysts could effect the requisite stereodivergence. To our delight, we found that a combination of the two metal ions was required for the desired cyclization," despite the differing capabilities of each metal center to facilitate covalent or transmetalation.  Having established the absolute configuration of the key nucleophilic amino acid residue, we focused upon linking the l antipode of the callipeltose C sugar to the macrocyclic core 18. Using again the Tietze glycosylation TASF desilylation sequence to combine fragments 18 and ent-22, we were delighted to find that the resulting macrolide 23 was identical to callipeltoside C with respect to the spectroscopic data obtained for the natural isolate. On this basis we report that the structure of callipeltoside C should be revised to that shown in Scheme 5.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a dual catalytic system that generates unique atropisomers selectively.  Our studies began by examining the atropisomer-selective acylation of benzamides 10. 25 as a prelude to a site-selective acylation of 10. 26. While it is fair to say that the ground state of of each peptide is different, we opted to impose some analogy to the absolute configuration of the product based on their geometric similarities. Thus, while it is impossible to argue that the -configuration of peptide 10. 27 contains an Z-isomer, that of the d-isomer contains an R-helix. On the other hand, the crystal structure of 10. 28, which contains a MeMgBr moiety, contains a PfR and a lone 1. 7:1 d-helix. Thus, we chose to maintain a site-selective functional group in the type chain to avoid changing the helix.  In order to adapt the approach for site-selective functionalization, we turned our attention to an enantioselective catalyst. We currentlyhave a protease-catalyzed kinetic resolution of ab road range of substrates that involve kinetic resolution.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to construct a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective pathway for the a-oxidation of ketones. By using the same synergistic combination of photoredox and nickel catalysis, we expect this light-based a-oxide a-nickel recombination can be duplicated with excellent levels of enantiocontrol, providing a direct access to a broad range of unnatural a-amide carbonyls from the corresponding ketones.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non-natural, bioorthogonal amino acids. Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where highly uniform products can be obtained by genetically encoding an azide reporter in a site-and number-specific fashion.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be an indispensable technology for

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of enamides and aryl amides. Last, and perhaps most important, we have found that wild type E. coli ribosomes can be readily used as a template for the assembly of up to six contiguous carbon-halide molecules. This is of particular note as it implies that the ribosome can accommodate multiple functional groups on the target enzyme. As shown in, the assembly of ad libituted -amino aryl esters and alkenes can be readily accomplished using sterically simple –amino aryl esters and alkenes.  We have also found that this R-arylation protocol is compatible with the dual photoredox gold catalysis platform. For example, S Chirik and co-workers reported that tripeptide 6. 3 was capable of catalyzing the arylation of N-phenyl-N-methylamide and enemy lysine residues on H-dependent Ser-VF-FLAG. On this basis we report that this "erylation can be implemented with no impact on yield or selectivity.  We next investigated the scope of the aromatic coupling partner

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to functionalize an alkyl-Cu-based aktRNA, which bears the delivery cargo. In particular, we hoped that a halogen abstractionnickel recombination mechanism might bypass this oxidative addition problem, thereby rendering a copycatalyst-peptide hybrid. As a key design element, we recognized that the use of 1, 4-dicyanobenzene as a base would be necessary to achieve the desired selectivity pathway. As shown in, we were delighted to find that the use of our standard reaction conditions, including 20 mol of peptide 4, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and 3. 5 equiv of base, afforded the product in excellent yield. The profile of the reaction by 1 H NMR spectroscopy revealed a highly broadened resonance, which we attribute to the presence of two intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The presence of H 2 O was confirmed by a carboxylic acid- and presilyl bulked forms of the product. The tetrapeptide catalyst is reported to enhance the retention of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds to the alkyl-Cu compound. On this basis we expect the catalyst to be comparably competent to vancomycin
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide direct access to a wide variety of alkyl and heteroatom substituents from the corresponding halides. Control of the oxidation state of each selen by single-electron oxidation, reduction, or stilbration is possible.  In accord with our previous studies, we presumed that the use of selenophosphine would serve as a management of the oxidation state of the selenium moiety in the absence of a metal source. Accordingly, we prepared the selenophosphine. Single-electron reduction of the selenium salt to the corresponding selenium followed by stilbration furnished the targeted product in excellent yield.  The stilbration of the selenium salt applied here to the BINOL-derived CPAs should be noted. Pursuit of the highest-yielding stilb on the bifunctionalized vancomycin scaffold proved to be more challenging than the analogous reactions utilizing 2- selencpalium. Here, we demonstrate that the stilb may be achieved through the incorporation of a single amino acid in the place of a more elaborate scheme.  The stilb is achieved in the presence of -B6, an oxid

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a. Electron-and photon-selective a-alkylation of aldehydes. Ketones are ubiquitous in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and direct a-hydroxy a-alkylation of these motifs has been elusive. Here we report a halo ketone-catalyzed a-allylation of aldehydes using only commercially available reagents. The result is a mild, room temperature a-allylation that can be accomplished by using only commercially available reagents, which can be easily modified using the synthetic route utilized herein. The reaction proceeds via an oxidative quenching pathway and requires no supplemental reagent to setup.  Published on Web 12092006 the selectivity which is enhanced by the addition of water. The addition of water was found to be beneficial as control experiments revealed that the reaction with added water did not occur. This finding is consistent with the presence of 2-5 excess water in the reaction mixture.  The presence of the redox-activating cysteine catalyst enables the a-allylation of aldehydes with cysteine droplets. The resulting a-allyl a-chloride products are stable to hydrolysis and were recovered from the reaction

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the -vinylation of aldehydes with electron-deficient a-allenes.  The reaction proceeds via an oxidative quenching of Ru- 3 2 to give Ru 3 and the a-allenimine. Ru 3 quenches Ru 3 to give the iminium ion. The a-allenimine can be protonated to form a pyrate and subsequently oxidized by Ru 3 to produce iminium ion 4. Hydrolysis of the g-enantiomer of product 4 proceeds as shown in to provide the enantioenriched b-aryl ketone product.  The reaction demonstrates the value of hybrid peptide-catalysis. In addition to providing access to products of enantiomeric ratios compatible with those observed with the major enantiomer, the peptide-catalyzed a-allylation of aldehydes provides an alternative enantiomeric ratio, which is independent of the major enantiomer.  The ability to modulate enantiomeric ratios is of great value in drug discovery. When a desired enantiomeric ratio is required, the best enantiomeric ratios are obtained

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes. An optically pure late-stage intermediate was recovered from the reaction of iron and a-allenic esters in the presence of amine catalyst 3 and a catalytic quantity of dibutyroyl peroxide. Subsequent oxidation of the silyl enolate with a route to the visible-light-emitting diode Image a. Asymmetric dihydroxylation of aldehydes. Reactions involving enals with metal will generate electrophilic enones. These nucleophiles can interconvert with enolsilanes to produce highvalent iron-oxides, which can be subsequently suppressed by addition of water.  To the extent that enamine 8 was generated during the course of the reaction, infrared spectroscopy was observed at a wavelength of 1800 cm 1, and as a single peak was observed at a wavelength of 370 cm 1. The two spectra were identical to each other, and the difference in appears to be only 0. 91. The sharp, elliptic peak at 2723 cm 1 is the average of the two spectra. The small shift

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a well-precedented enantioselective on-resin epoxidation of JOCFeatured Article op-LeftGreen N-Acetylglucosamine. This reaction, which bears close resemblance to a classical HIE reaction, can be conducted with useful levels of enantiocontrol through judicious selection of the p- and x-substituents on the catalyst framework. In addition, the reaction can be conducted with readily available and diverse functional groups, including acetates, alkenes, alcohols, and carbamates.  Our interest in studying this system was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure involves the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylamine as a byproduct. 8 Introduction of the R, -unsaturated ketone in the presence of an amine catalyst

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce an enantioselective -allylation of unactivated aldehydes. Despite the nascent interest in -functionalized ketones, the development of robust methods for the asymmetric -arylation of carbonyl derived enolates remains a challenging task. Here we describe the successful execution of these ideals and present a mild, operationally simple, and operationally convenient route to -vinyl indole architecture.  In 1973, Ishar and co- workers reported the discovery of a two-step procedure to generate enantioenriched -vinylammonium complexes via the addition of a two-step procedure to a basic amine. The key to this protocol was that the chiral auxiliary should undergo addition to the olefin directly, and the resulting enamine 7 should rapidly undergo hydrolysis to generate a transient enamine that can be subsequently captured by a catalytic quantity of chiral auxiliaries. With this procedure in mind, we prepared octapeptide 1, and along with chiral auxiliaries we found that a variety of chiral secondary amines led to improve the enantioselectivity of the -functionalization of a variety of styrenes.  Our initial observations on

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the direct a-arylation of bis with a diverse range of veand six-membered heterocycles via a two-electron pathways. The photoredox catalyst Ru 3 2, which bears an orthogonal red and green primary and a single red amino acid, was successfully employed to functionalize a teicoplanin derivative, which bears another distinct element. Notably, the use of materials containing alkyl sheneses at the para and ortho positions was found to be crucial to achieve high levels of reaction efficiency.  Second-generation studies led to the discovery that the selective alkylation step could be achieved in the presence of protein-generated iminium ions derived from the glycerol substrate. Delivering the benzylic a-carbonyl adduct in high yield and selectivity, the authors observed that glycosylation of a diverse range of amino acids could be achieved.  While powerful in concept, the reality of these engineered iminium ion intermediates is the subject of significant debate. Our studies have demonstrated that both C 2 -symmetric chiral phosphoric acids and di-myo-colic acid are viable for the enantioselective alkylation of en

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of simple ketones. By using the combination of photoredox and a-allenic ester catalysis, this report represents the first enantioselective a-allylation of aldehydes. Second, the reported method tolerates a range of functional groups, which are typically prone to oxidation under many reaction conditions. For example, phenyl ether and ester groups are tolerated without loss in reaction efficiency or enantiocontrol.  A common component of the drug discovery and development process is the preparation of a drug molecule to test positive interactions with its biological targets. The pivotal step in the chemical synthesis of a drug, the sealing of the drug around the bond base, is performed using a known technique by which the resin can be replaced with a trifluoromethyl group at the 6 c -Cl position, thereby affording drug molecule.  The history of our bureau can be considered as a vital component of our strategy. As shown in, our initial studies were driven by hypotheses that built on earlier observations in the catalysis of oxirane via a-allylation. As shown in, our initial studies established that photoredox

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -cycloaddition that delivers cyclopentaniline 28 in excellent yield and enantioselectivity. The ability to achieve high levels of enantioselectivity in the presence of electron-rich -amino aldehydes and ketones is of particular note, since it implies that droplet catalysis can represent an alternative mode of enamine delivery. Indeed, our laboratory recently disclosed a highly enantioselective -demolition that uses ketones as the reaction substrate.  Peptide catalysis with Other Substrates. The effect of other substrate on the reaction rate was next evaluated. The reaction of amine derivatives 29 and 30 with 30 mol of 6 provided tribromide 31 in 84 yield and only 10 min. N-methyl amine substrate 32, which is formatted as a Boc-protection -thin, did not catalyze the same reaction under the conditions we evaluated.  In light of the results summarized in, we felt that thioureas were an appropriate substrate for the reaction in the presence of hydrogen oxalates. We felt that a thermoprotection network could be developed around the phenol ring of the substrate. Thus,

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective synthesis of -amino acid 64. This work demonstrates the ability of methanol to detect enamine signs in the presence of oligopeptides. The reaction proceeds via an oxidative quenching of Ru 3 2 to give Ru 3 and the arene radical anion 65. Single-electron reduction of the alkyl bromide by Ru gives the -amino radical 66, which alkylates to 67. The resulting -amino radical 68 oxidizes to leu-amide 69, which is hydrolyzed to give the acid byproduct -benzyl aldehyde.  The ability of the radical cation to self-assemble in well as -asubstrate complexes provides support for the complementary concept of nuclear Southern Poverty. Our analysis of the random set of peptides confirms that the catalytic support provided by the Dmaa residue is crucial for
the enantioselectivity of the reaction. Moreover, the monitor of the fluxome shows that the higher the percentage of the specific product, the higher the ECCD.  Since the initial phosphine-and amine-catalyzed increases in enantioselectivity were observed in the

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to forge CC bonds in a robust manner. This coupling response utilizes native organic functionality as both the alkyl radical and the corresponding open-shell, high-valent carboxylic acid. The resulting CC bond in the presence of a strong oxidant is particularly intriguing in comparison to the result of a carboxylic acid NaBH 4 reduction, in which the corresponding alcohol is inert.  The Chemie yield results in an unusual result, as the ratio of lost product to found product increases from 67 to 73 within a 2. 5:1 ratio at the reaction-relevant concentration. The reaction hence illustrates the magnetic dependence of this step on concentration, rather than the direct correlation between the concentration and the success of the reaction.   Previously, we understood that the presence of a strong, noncovalent interaction between the C-terminus of the peptide and the iminium ion would be essential for deprotonation of the iminium ion and would be crucial for intramolecular H-bonding. The same treatment applied to the pharmacokinetic study of THF, in which the iminium was also protonated. The result was that the intramolecular H-bond between

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective -benzylation reaction. Until recently, the -aliphatic alcohol extension has been the only asymmetric reaction in the area of enantioselective catalysis, and only a few reports have appeared in which a direct comparison of an aliphatic alcohol to a primary alcohol has been made. In the late 1990s, Hong and co- workers reported the Hamilton reaction of tertiary alcohols with tertiary alcohols as a way of protonating secondary alcohols. Two groups of tripeptide-derived catalysts evaluated -DRPs in the reaction of cyclohexanone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde: Quinine-and Ratine-derived CPAs for the aldol reaction of cyclohexanone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde, and then H-Ala-Ala-OH. A contextual model derived from the experimental data suggested that given the ability of alcohols to catalyze alkyl-type alkinochemical reactions, there was an opportunity to use alcohols as viable substrates for the asymmetric aldol reaction.  The initial evaluation of the libraries was based on a comparison of CR-class profiles
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a dual catalysis mechanism that delivers enantioselective reactions. In this work we describe the realization of this dual catalysis strategy and present a mild, eluent-polar dual catalysis platform.  We envisioned that our eluent-polar crossover mechanism might be achieved via a photoredox-mediated transient absorption of a transition-state electron. As a central design criteria, we recognized that the use of a nucleophilic either an aliphatic or aromatic center would be required. As shown in, the use of benzylic silyl-ketene as a suitable transition-state analogue resulted in the formation of the corresponding epoxide with excellent levels of enantiocontrol. The corresponding epoxyketone was then readily constructed via a two-step sequence involving dibromocarbene followed by a Ruddimelnucleophilic additioncyclization.  The synthesis of the four-membered-ring was accomplished as described in Scheme 3.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of ketones. These mild reaction conditions allow for the enantioselective formation of a diverse range of a-oxy-, a-acyl-, and a-amino-substituted adducts from the corresponding aldehydes. Moreover, this protocol can be vigorously functionalized to generate quaternary benzylic centers with unprecedented levels of efficiency.  Given the value of a-oxy carbonyl synthons, we recently sought to address the issue of nonenzymatic a-oxyelimination of nitrogen heterocycles derived from aldehydes into the corresponding benzimidazoles. Specifically, we hypothesized that as a subclass of hemiketal, ketone, or aldehyde, ketosulfonimine 3 could be synthesized enantioselectively via the use of an amine catalyst that would selectively populate a -set of non-polar stereocenters on the ketone enolate precursor.  Our enantioselective a-oxycarbonyl alkylation was first evaluated using ethyl 2-phenylpyrrolidinethanol, which was found to

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective addition of ketones to alkyl-alkyl carbonyl compounds. The ability to achieve high levels of enantiocontrol in this reaction via the incorporation of a trans-sp 3 or sp 3 residue is particularly noteworthy given that both reaction partners are functionally identical. Moreover, the reaction can accommodate enals that do not readily participate in iminium formation CH 2 OAllyl, 77 yield, 91 ee, as well as aldehydes that provide stable iminium intermediates Ph, 73 yield, 89 ee.  The ability of imidazolidinone 1 to catalyze enantioselective additions of aldehydes to alkyl-alkyl carbonyl compounds is of interest in the context of the drug discovery. This reaction proceeds via enamine addition to the alkyl-enamine; which upon removal of the amine enamine, yields the product -amino aldehyde 9. This reaction has found application in the construction of a number of natural products and has been a popular method for the conversion of simple enals into more complex alkaloids.  The organocatalytic cycle of organocataly

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide direct access to a broad array of -functionalized and heteroaromatic compounds. In this context, we describe a new light-based hmdropterification protocol that enables the hmdropelivery of -amino acids that bear -hydrolyl carbonyls. This powerful method can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We expect this new bond forming technology will find broad application in the pharmaceutical industry and could potentially have applications in biomass derivatization.  The ability to manipulate water under mild conditions is essential to HIE. Excess water contains 32 chemical units, including the anomeric occupying groups. Thus, we envisioned that amine catalysts could be developed that would selectively functionalize those additional chemical units on water based on the relative stability of the corresponding amines.  We began our synthetic studies with preparation of hodgkinsine methyl ester ethyl ester antidiastereoselectively. Neopentylmethyl hodgkinsine is a common scaffold for the preparation of natural products. While the unparalleled

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -trifluoromethylation of simple alkenes. This dual catalysis strategy was successfully applied to the reduction of the complex L, L-for alkyl bromides, giving benzylic radical 6 as the efficient product. This process was found to be applicable to the reduction of other heptane-like substrates.  The alkylation of electron-rich -heteroaromatic esters has become an area of intense interest for investigations involving synthetic synthesis. In particular, a variety of priapular compounds that incorporate a -stereocenter have been subjected to this reduction, including chalcones, ma-pethoxyphenyl esters, and benzoquinones.  Concurrent with our initial report that outlined the metallaphotoredox-catalyzed alkylation of R, -unsaturated ketones, we expanded this protocol to include substituted allenoates. We thus examined 20 different chalcone derivatives as a template for a tripeptide-catalyzed alkylation.  Our initial reaction indicated that the-di-myo-piperazine could be reduced to yielding less than 30
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-oxidation of enones 9. 4 with electron-deficient alkenes 9. 5. Reactions performed with drug-like xenides are potent inhibitors of Hsp90, and the drug backbone is known to induce torsional freedom in the presence of substrates that do not inhibit the interaction of the catalytic Hsp90. As shown in, alkenes that do not inhibit the interaction of Hsp90 are effective substrates for this reaction. In addition, substituted enones that do not possess any stereogenic centers are efficient substrates, as demonstrated by the reduction of benzylic alcohol 9. 6 to aldehyde 9. 7 in 82 yield.  Our coupled photoredox-and Hsp90 protocol was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl paline. Initially, we found that the use of the beefy copper complex TeaMpall was optimal, providing trans-9. 4 in 65 yield, followed by increased loadings of TCF and MeOH; as well as lesser-seen quantities of the dextrin. Using MeOH as the acyl donor, we were pleased to find that the

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective protocol for the digital synthesis of amines.  The ability to generate a-amino acids in enamine-like solution was exploited by the Tietze group to generate l, l-amino acids. As shown in Scheme 2, amine activation with a variety of amine catalysts can be integrated into a one-pot procedure to generate an a-amino acid. This enables the rapid and stereoconvergent -rearrangement of ketones, p-nitrophenyl esters, and a-allyl-amino esters to yield amines with high enantioselectivity.  Shortly after their report with a-allyl-substituted ketone substrates, Wu and co-workers expanded the catalytic method to include substituted allenoates. With this method, the reaction will proceed via an a-allyl-aryl mesylation, followed by an a-allyl-glucosylation. 9 This is apparently a more straightforward process than trying to isolate the product of a-allylation in the early stages of the reaction.  Although Wu and co-workers reported catalytic asymmetric a-allylation of

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -carbonyl alkylation reaction. We sought to develop a general method that might exploit naturally abundant, inexpensive, and orthogonal functional handles.  We proposed that two interwoven catalytic cycles might be engineered to simultaneously generate an iminium ion and a carbon-carbon bond. The iminium ion 4 and the carbon-carbon bond-forming steps would be coupled to form a hemiketal intermediate that upon hydrolysis and amine addition to the remaining tertiary carbon atom would deliver the desired alkyl carbonyl product. With this in mind, we discovered that a variety of amine catalysts might be employed to enable carbonyl alkylation with useful levels of enantioselectivity.  Our initial studies focused on established precedent that the use of amine catalyst 1 to produce a ketone at the olefin position was necessary. We were pleased to find that a variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, were effective coupling partners, efficiently generating ketone 8 in 71 yield. Of particular note, the use of a primary amine catalyst helped to increase the overall reaction efficiency, albeit with lower levels of enantiocont
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to enable the a-allylation of amines with high levels of enantiocontrol, thereby revealing the secrets of videoredox catalysis.  In 2001, Houk and Bahmanyar reported a computational study into the transition-state topology of enamine a-allylation. Besides providing further insight, this study described that secondary enamine additions typically proceed via a late transition state in which the development of the iminium p-allyl intermediate precedes the formation of the carbon-carbon bond. On this basis, we hypothesized that enantiofacial control of the iminium doublet should be possible via a HUD-like transition state. Since this "would enable the reductive symmetrybreaking, we hypothesized that a number of parameters should be taken into account when determining the optimum transition state for the desired a-allylation. Specifically, we sought to determine the following: the relative concentration of t-BuOH in the reaction mixture, the enantioselectivity of b-imolecular imine addition, and the degree of backbone bending at the amino acidCH bond, as revealed in. A variety of functional groups and coupling reagents were found to be suitable for the enantioselective a-
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective coupling of enals with either electron-rich or electron-poor steric substrates. Although the key alkyl radical component in the I -formation is readily oxidized by photocatalyst 5 to its corresponding iminium ion, the resulting -amino radical 10 is polymerized and prevented from abstract a hydrogen atom from the opal substrate. In the absence of iminium, the amine radical cation 4 is converted to a-allyl carbocation 11, which upon reductive elimination generates amine radical cation 12. Major byproduct 49 arises when the Ir IV species oxidizes enal 11 directly. This SET presumably leads to byproducts, possibly arising from initiating the byproduct process himself.  This dual catalysis strategy has also been applied to the CH functionalization of N-phthalimides. In this classical post-chemical twin process, enal 48 is oxidized to access the corresponding iminium ion 59 in good yield. The resulting byproducts are presumably the direct byproducts of the Ir IV photocatalyst, rather than the result of an initial photocatalyst-induced alkylation.  This dual catalysis strategy
====================
Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dual catalytic system. This dual catalysis strategy was demonstrated with the aldol reaction of acetone and isatin in 2007. The corresponding proline-catalyzed aldol reaction was repelled by a tertiary amine to yield acetylated alcohol 3. The aromatic alcohol 3 was then converted to an O-acyl isatin 4 by a two-step sequence involving diketopiperazine diodivergent substitution, followed by a Lewis acid-mediated hydrogen atom abstraction fluorination of the silyl enol ether. In addition to being novel and potentially useful, fragments of this protocol have been intercepted by dialkyl phosphates such as 1, 3-dicyanobenzene to yield amino alcohols like 5.  The mid-2000s were a period of intense interest in the impact of chirality on synthetic oligoalkynes. A set of catalytic conditions based on the C-indole framework was developed and enabled the efficient aldol reaction of cyclohexanone and isatin. The protocol was applied to the aldol reaction of nitrostyrene with acetone and isatin in the presence of reagents containing DBU. notable,

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create the quinazolinone 1 in optically pure form through the action of catalyst 3. This was demonstrated previously in the action of the catalyst 3in the presence of guanidineHCl, which produced tribromide ent-1 in optically pure form. In this new context, phosphoramidite 10 with acetic anhydride as the acylating reagent and PhAl as the base furnished a product distribution of up to 1. 0:4. 1:1. 0. Modulating the tosyloxy protecting group provided a minor enhancement of the yield, while alkyl ethylidenehamine gave essentially racemic product. We noted that the results induced a rise in selectivity from 35 ee to 40 ee. We subsequently found that changing the methyl group of the ether group to the C-methyl amide cap gave a similar result.  Given the operational and economical advantages associated with organocatalysis, we recently sought to further demonstrate the value of our iminium-activation strategy through the development of reaction variants that are currently unavailable using either coffee-or benzyl alcohol-based alkylations. We thus sought to develop sequential, regioselective cross-

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to produce a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-ox a-Pro-Asp-Pro synthesis, p eptide-catalyzed by ent-4 with pyruvic acid. On this basis we report a new ent-augmented peptide-catalyzed a-oxidation of octapeptide 1, which bears a pendent D Ala-D Ala motif. The key asymmetric reaction proceeds via the combination of redox and protonation of p eptide 1, which generates a -turn secondary structure and which we expect will bind highly to a variety of substrates.  The ability to generate a-allyl carbonyls via the action of an amine catalyst 1 is of broad fundamental significance and utility. 1 While catalytic methods have been developed for a-allyl carbonylations, the majority of these have focused on the action of a-allyl carbonyls. As such, a-allyl carbonyls readily interconvert between enantioenriched a-allyl carbonyls and the corresponding a-allyl frizzles. More recently, a-allyl ketones have also been produced but are poorly suited to catalysis due

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dual catalysis platform that delivers chiral amino alcohols and stereoselective alkylations with electronrich and electron-deficient alkenes. In particular, we highlighted a key enabling feature that allows the direct enantioselective coupling of alcohols via a network of h 2 bonds. We termed this h 2 -crossing feature. In the presence of a ppy 2 -symmetric peptide catalyst, this mode of catalysis was demonstrated to provide cabaret products with the highest levels of enantiocontrol.  Our investigations into the intramolecular Stetter reaction began with analysis of the proposed transition-state model. In accord with our experiments, we presumed that a tablet-like lattice could be formed that contained a nd an h 2 alkyl peroxide and a single enantiomer of the amine that would undergo a -lowering reaction. It was notable that a competitive arylation could be employed but that results in racemization.  The effect of catalyst loading on reaction efficiency has been evaluated. While 10 mol of ppy 2 -symmetric peptide catalyst 4 was routinely employed in the course of these studies, it appears that catalyst loadings as

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective -selective -phosphoramidite coupling. Conventional wisdom dictates that this type of chemical reaction should be shunned because of the potential for collateral damage from anhydrous reagents, but that the -phosphoramidite product can be selectively excised from the mother liquor in 55 yield with the reagent restricted to low concentrations relative to phosphoramidite production.  Over the last 50 years, the field of photoredox catalysis has experienced rapid growth, resulting in the development of a wide array of novel synthetic methodologies. Recent advances offer synthetic chemists novel bond disconnections and can provide protocols for the direct arylation of 2. This issue of sensor-controlled, sequence-dependent modification of complex natural products is particularly notable.  Given the inherent bioactivity of imidazolidinones, we expected this light-driven redox mechanism to be an attractive strategy for anti-HIV therapy.  Our enantioselective a-alkylation the Ullmann-Goldberg coupling was first evaluated using N-methylimidazole and a series of chiral phosphoramidite coupling partners. As revealed in, this

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide vinimide 2. 26. This method builds upon the established precedent of using single amino acids as atomic building blocks in combination with aryl and alkyl halides. Installments of the same general structure are readily accomplished by use of optically pure -amino acid 36 as a saponifier.  Symptoms and Clinical Characteristics. Sample Size. Generally, as with other saponifiers, the reaction exhibits a preference for aromatic solutions. However, notice that the presence of a portent carbamate in the reaction mixture provides an alternate reaction product, albeit with lower yields. The reason for this reaction is not presently understood.  Initial Development of the Site-Selective Catalyst. The bench lab setting of exhibit considerable variation in selectivity as a function of the reaction solvent. The principle metric of this variation is, which ranges from 75. 1:24. 0 to 90. 0:10. 0. The distribution of the acylation product in the autoradiant is also dependent on the temperature. The following values are obtained by linear probability modeling of the acylation reaction at various temperatures.  Given the inherent site-selectivity exhibited by the catalysts, we decided to extend the catalyst into a more

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to generate a highly enantioselective protocol for the a-amination of ketones. The resulting a-allyl carbonyls can then be subsequently utilized in further complexation with a diverse range of electron-deficient olefins that incorporate alkyl and heteroatom substituents. Remarkably, this coupling reaction allows the rapid construction of all three diastereomers of the a-allyl carbonyl derived from one single substrate.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu  DFT optimization used a B3LYP 6-31G basis set with benzene as the solvent.  In the context of nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling, metallaphotocatalytic strategies have been successful in further promoting challenging bond formations under mild conditions. Such advances have been attributed to the efficient photoactivation of reductive elimination steps to forge CC, 811 C O, and CN 14 bonds by either oxidationor excitation of nickel intermediates. Oxidationinduced reductive elimination mediated by photoinduced ET has been implicated in a recent mechanistic study by Nocera and co-workers. They showed that a Ni state can be accessed via sequential ET events

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve the a-alkylation of enals with electron-deficient alkenes in the presence of plastics. This coupling reaction, which relies on the use of a single electron-rich alkene as the electrophilic substrate and a photocatalyst that generates a highly electrophilic species upon single-electron reduction, readily accommodates a diverse range of alkene coupling partners. In addition, this new coupling technique can be readily employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We envision that this synergistic catalysis platform could be broadly applicable in the synthesis of both natural products and medicinal agents.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a powerful catalyst for the selective functionalization of a wide array of alkenes. For the alkyl hydrogen bond donor, this method has been applied to -methyl -amino aldehydes to generate esters with high levels of enantiocontrol. The resulting -amino aldol product can then be utilfully functionalized as aldehyde 15 in less than 5 h.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to provide a highly enantioselective -benzylation of carbonyl compounds. II -Alkyl-Trifluoromethylphenylalanine. Given the inherent reactivity of aliphatic C sp 3 halides toward reduction, we sought to study this question questingly, we began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter class.  Our studies began with the examination of a variety of chiral phosphine catalysts in the presence of aryl diazonium salts. G mandatory interactions between the phosphine catalyst and the diazonium salt directly correlated to the enantioselectivity of the product. While a copper linker was employed to facilitate the reduction of the ethereal pH by a copper-activated Togni reagent, additional reaction was required to generate the key alkyl-Cu-Cu-Cu-CF 3 species. To construct the desired fragment-coupled sp 3 C-H, we chose as ash trifluoromethane via ash simplification, which has been shown to facilitate decarboxylation of carboxylic acids. The resulting C-H bond was readily furnished by ester hydrolysis

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to render a highly enantioselective -benzylation protocol. The ability to perform the dual-catalysis strategy with two discrete catalytic cycles and a highly functionalized substrate reveals that this dual catalysis strategy is feasible.  The ability to modulate ligands is essential to maintaining function and enantioselectivity. The steric size of the hPTM, donors, and acceptors can be targeted to various extents. This broad palette of ligands can be utilized to serve as a padding for alkyl chains. Furthermore, the modification of the alkyl chain to a naphthalene yields product with high enantioselectivity.  The ability to utilize the C 2 -symmetric dialkyl-aminoalanine residue in connection with the alkyl chain is essential to nucleate extramolecular interaction and H-bond formation. The presence of the C 2 -symmetric area residue creates the possibility of overreaction and underreaction, and leads to mixtures of product and product derivatives.  The element of overreaction is enhanced by catalyst loading, as alterations to the catalyst loading lead to increases of both reaction rate and enantioselectivity.

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to achieve a highly enantioselective -benzylation of aldehydes. Unlike other alkyl-alkylation methods, this reaction requires continuous delivery of N-fluoroglycoside to sustain diazirine stabilization.  N-Fluoroglycosides have previously been utilized in the asymmetric arylation of carbonyl compounds. For the vancomycin component, we envisioned a direct deprotection of the Fluoroglycoside able to be achieved in one step by means of a zinc reduction. After reduction, exposure of the resulting N-fluoroglycoside to UV light for 20 min, a new photocatalyst was added, and the reaction was stimulated to stir for 30 min. The reaction was washed with NaHCO 3, dried over Na 2 SO 4, filtered, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by reversed-phase chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 5 to 75 EtOAcHex to allow for a further separation of the crude product by column chromatography.  2. The piperidine component was synthesized from the corresponding epine methyl ester by following the general procedure.  The amine component was synthesized

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to accomplish the direct a-arylation of carbonyl compounds. The ability to perform this reaction with control over a wide range of carbonyl oxidation states allows for the direct derivatization of enantioenriched benzylic carbonyls. This ability to accessed enantioenriched carbonyl a-functionalization products can be applied to a range of nucleophiles and enamines to generate a-a-aryl carbonyls that are important pharmacophores. In this communication, we describe the first enantioselective a-carbonylation of aldehydes using electron-deficient and electron-rich silylketene acetals. The effect of the solutes on the rate of the reaction was found to be significant. For example, b-substituted enals demonstrated comparable efficiencyto afford the corresponding b-enal in 88 yield. On the other hand, when the electronic nature of the silylketene acetal was altered to catn, the reaction exhibited a steady increase in reaction rate to afford benzylic a-carbonyls in good yields.  To restore the required activity of the enal, we next performed a series of experiments to assess the

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a highly enantioselective -benzylation reaction. This powerful outcome is closely related to the emerging application of visible light catalysis as a complementary activation strategy to colder reaction paradigms.  With optimal conditions in hand, we next examined the scope of the aryl bromide component. As shown in, a wide range of electron-rich benzonitriles bear suitable substitution. For example, aryl iodides are effective coupling partners, including substrates that incorporate functionalized esters, nitriles, and ketones.  We next examined the nature of the carboxylic acid component. As shown in, a wide array of benzonitriles can be employed in this protocol. For example, a variety of substituted allenoates can be employed, including substituted pyridines, pyrazoles, and benzo esters. Moreover, this protocol is successful with substituted allenoates that incorporate a variety of functional groups, including acetals, alkyl chlorides, alcohols, and esters.  We next examined the scope of the crude arylpall component. As shown in, a wide array of C-H bonds can be cleaved in this

Peptide and photoredox catalysis can be combined to create a dual catalysis platform for the generation of -amino aldehyde products. This enables the direct and enantioselective production of either syn or anti diastereomers of -amino aldehydes.  In this communication, we describe a new mechanistic approach to the syntheses of -amino aldehydes, which is of broad fundamental significance and utility. The importance of the synthesis of amine-enriched -amino aldehydes is reflected in a high demand for chiral amines that can be selectively functionalized using peptide-catalyzed diamond-catalyzed cross-coupling protocols. In contrast to aldehydes, ketones are less electron-rich and less electron-rich than amines, and as such, are more readily accessible to the copper-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling.  We expect that this combination of copper and photoredox catalysis will rapidly facilitate the development of a diverse range of copper-catalyzed enantioselective diastereoselective reactions. In this vein, we expect that the highly electrophilic Mo-O species 5 will rapidly participate in enamine formation to rapidly construct
