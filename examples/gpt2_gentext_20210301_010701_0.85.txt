Peptide catalysis can be applied to allenic esters that are substituted at the -position. We were pleased to find that aromatic, substituted allenoates bearing g-substituted backbones yield effective coupling partners. As demonstrated in, cyclopentene is a competent substrate, allowing formation of product 38a with 98 ee.  The reaction proceeds with acceptable reaction efficiency in the presence of other nucleophilic amino acid residues that participate in the BINAP-proliferation pathway. For example, catalyst 47a forms the conjugate addition product when the reaction is conducted with residue at the -position. Similarly, the BINAP-proliferation product 40 is observed when the reaction is conducted with residue at the -position.  In summary, we have developed a new strategy for the direct construction of modular BINAP-like scaffolds, which permits the modular installation of small -turns into easily accessible scaffolds. This new ALI-P functionalization approach enables the construction of either the left-hand or the right-hand quadrant.  The L-Pro Series. To a reaction vessel was added 100 mg of TentaGel spheres 1 and 2. 0 mL of DMF. The mixture was agitated to hom

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes, this reaction exhibits broad latitude with respect to the electronic nature of the aldehyde component. As shown in, a wide range of functional groups can be readily employed on the aldehydic substrate.  The effect of the acid chloride component on the aldehyde component has been evaluated. Application of this method to the a-methylhyde of pentenal 9. 15 led to the a-hydroxy a-methyl aldehyde 10 with complete conversion to 10 as determined by GLC. The method is also tolerant of various substitution on the acyclic benzylic carbon of the aldehyde component.  It is important to note that the b-hydroxy aldehyde product 10 was produced with only 25 mol of the dibenzyl imidazolidinone catalyst 11 at 15C in our presence. The failure of this method with a variety of substitution on the acyclic benzylic carbon renders it less effective as a hydrogen atom donor.  The most notable result to emerge from the ketone determination study was the degree of difunctionalization that was achieved. As illustrated in, we subjected atrop

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of diseases and targets from the simple derivatives of amino acids.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining a. b-Stetter reaction between 4-methoxyphenyl-N-methylamide and a variety of amines. We were pleased to find that this photo-cyclization protocol was compatible with the 26-methoxy recessive phenol framework of the diazo compound, allowing use of the non-natural amine on the biphenyl ring.  We next examined the scope of the amine component in this new cycloaddition protocol. As shown in, a wide range of substituted decatrees can be readily employed in the reaction, including cyclopropyl, alipropyl, and benzyl. It is of note that the sense of asymmetric induction observed in all casesis consistent with selective interaction of the phenyl ring with the aldehyde substrate, rather than with each of the two isomer 8a8a.  We next examined the application of

Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-and site-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non- natural ingredients. Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where highly uniform products can be obtained by genetically encoding an azide reporter in a site-and number-specific fashion.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be an indispensable technology for selective protein modification, but the bioconjugation strategies that harness the amino acids of wild-type proteins remain elusive, despite their great appeal. Traditionally, these native

Peptide catalysis can be applied to enantioselective glycosylation as well as enantioselective alkylation of amino acids and allyl carbonates.  Complex natural products continue to be a quintessential interdisciplinary nexus. Whether through their isolation, characterization, or biosynthetic study, the interplay of the biological and the mechanical environments in order to fully comprehend the biological basis of the complex nature of these molecules is ongoing. At the same time, the unique nature of the polypeptide-based nature of the polymeric catalysts that operate at room temperature we observe a futuristic variety of complex structures that defy conventional utility in conventional chemical synthesis. As shown in, many of these barriers to conventional bond formation are operative on a physical scale reasonable to consider. The accessibility of non-traditional, prehelical structures also appears to be a consideration in light of the experimental evidence for their part. In this context, we were interested in exploring the possibility of developing an enantioselective method for the addition of an unsubstituted allyl group to a polyene. The endeavor was based on a catalytic asymmetric approach, wherein an arene could be employed to generate a Varenicinlike adduct that could be subsequently combined with

Peptide catalysis can be applied to both a monodifferentiated library of solvents and to a discrimially diverse set of catalytically generated -turn and -hairpin structures. The efficacy of this approach may be reflected in the diminished selectivity of this catalytic system, which yields products with er values but at reasonable rates.  The nucleophide glycosides have emerged as attractive catalysts for the selective activation of glycosyl reactions. First, their catalytic power has been demonstrated in the site-selective conversion of simple galactones to enolates. Second, the nightly discovery of new chemical strategies that employ the glycosyl electrophile as a glycosyl acceptor

The diacetylolysis-cyclization cascade of chiral secondary amines to enamine, which proceeds from enamine to iminium ion 7, proceeds from a tandem process involving both iminium ion 14 and a pyramidal iminium ion 15.  Interest in the glycopeptide b-turn as a catalyst for the conjugate addition of an achiral nucleophile to an achiral carbonyl is prevalent

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of many naturally occurring compounds and complex inositol phosphates. Inositol phosphates are critical intermediates in signal transduction and are represented in the phosphodiester peak in the HPLC trace for the inositol monophosphatase E.  In addition to myo-inositides, phosphorylated inositol-3-phosphate and inositol-3, 5-bisphosphate were also used as the primary materials to yield products with high enantioselectivity. The use of acetonitrile as the acyl donor was necessary to obtain high levels of enantioselectivity for many substrates and was specifically developed by Glorius and co-workers using acetic anhydride. After recrystallization of the beads under hydrogenolysis conditions, the reddish-brown material was detected. The authors identified the same catalyst-controlled selectivity when using triethylamine as the acyl donor. The authors synthesized each of the inositol polyphosphates in their own time, and they later used their established electrophilic d-phosphine-catalyzed desymmetrization to investigate the stereochemical configuration of the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the source of stereopolarity. Single-bead fluorescence microscopy, in which the out-of-focus fluorophores are generated by single-bead fluorescence, has been applied to the research of enantioselective hydrolysis of amino acid esters. The rate of the acid-deprotonation process can be determined by the intensity of the fluorescence. Slow evaporation of the fluorescence reveals a high probability that the active catalyst will diffuse further and capture proteins on a given surface. Practical care should be taken to ensure that the intensity of the fluorescence does not correlate with the concentration of the imine. On a given scale, the dissolution of [ ers and peaks from the fluorescence can be measured by versus. A typical two-photon fluorescence has been identified as an excellent sensor for in situ screening of libraries of resin-bound compounds. For application to the synthesis of new medicinal agents, single-bead fluorescence has been historically limited to the concentration of 0. 4 M in organic solvents. However, using the recently developed photoredox strategy, we were able to identify three catalysts that are significantly more active than H 2 at 1. 0 M

Peptide catalysis can be applied to other nucleobase pairs, including aliphatic, aromatic, achiral, and benzylic hydroxyl groups.  We next explored the scope of the aldehyde substrate in this enantioselective a-allylation protocol. As shown in, a wide range of functional groups, including olefins, esters, amines, carbamates, and aryl rings can be readily tolerated on the aldehydic substrate. Moreover, considerable variation in the steric demands of the aldehyde component can be accommodated nonyl, cyclohexyl, Bn, Ph, adamantyl without loss in efficiency or enantiocontrol Ph, Me, OMe, SMe, Glu, and Zn, entries 27. In accord with established Claisen protocols, we found that a broad array of styrenes can be employed as suitable substrates for this enantioselective a-allylation.  As revealed in, this catalytic strategy is tolerant to enolic coupling partners that incorporate arenes, esters, amines, carbamates, and aryl rings. To highlight both the functional tolerance and the preparative utility of this new a-

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of nucleophiles that incorporate a variety of functional groups, including arenes and imines. In the context of drug discovery, peptides containing protected-and unsymmetrical residues are particularly well-suited to subserve a -functionalized windshield. Off the other hand, so-called -hairpins built into peptides or proteins by chemical synthesis are ubiquitous in the literature.  The excretion of medicinal agents is facilitated by close communication between the drug candidate and the catalyst. In a similar way, the excretion of biases provides an important internal measure of the discrimination of the two possible conformations.  Nine independent total syntheses of -aprenaline-vancomycin have been achieved. In the public discourse, numerous "official spokesmen have addressed the issue of right-handed bias in the evaluation of new drug candidates. For scientists who specialize in one or more specific classes of interest, annual reports on the strength of affirmative action can be relied upon. However, the type of titration used in these studies makes it a challenge to achieve as high a degree of selectivity as possible.  The use of compounds like 4 as a tool in chemical synthesis provides a volatile analytical tool. Each compound possesses

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the derivatization of several other amino acid residues on Semeboraceton-G ousINE nucleoside. Screening of p-hydroxybenzyltryptophalan s-phenylalanine led to the identification of a number of hit catalysts, including 10. 27b, which desymmetrized the base to afford hydroxyindolenine in 80 yield and 77 ee. By virtue of the extremely fast reaction rates, photoredox catalysis proved to be a viable strategy for the reconstruction of several alkene isomers. By virtue of the highly enantioselective catalysis, tentatively assigned as the family of catalysts, m ut hioamide 10. 33 could be accessed in good yield and with good enantioselectivity.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly diastereo-and enantioselective addition of aldehydes to TentaG ous. Our results include the study of all possible diastereomers of a given peptide,, appearance of a few that are unique, and some that are common. Diversity-wise addition products are very welcome.  Naturally occurring Tyr-O-glycosides have been observed in the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of nucleophiles that incorporate a variety of functional groups at the 6-20 nm. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the combination of aryl-and vinyl-substituted myo-inositol could be used to catalyze the desymmetrization of 2-iodopyridine via enamine-catalyzed halogenation using turbinonnucleophilic diazonium salts. In contrast to the method described herein, we felt that it was a likely possibility that an analogous mechanism might be operational wherein [ Stroke product 11. A detailed discussion of this possibility is included in the Appendix.  As shown in, we prepared the inositol phosphorylation inhibitor leading to the tris-phosphate. We expecting that treatment with a suitable oxidant would produce a species that should rapidly partition to the iminium species indicated in. In the event, exposure of 9 to a Renethe highlight of the iminium ion followed by a SET event with the oxidation product 10 is sufficient for producing the key cIP product.  The synthesis of 10 was then accomplished as described in Scheme 5. In this method, the photoexcited species Ru 3 is sufficiently

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate all types of functional groups that should be readily available in enantiopure form. In the context of peptides that incorporate protected homopolymers, directional selectivity can be achieved through the inclusion of either L-or D-proline and alkyl- or alkylpalladium species. With respect to the alkyl-and l-proline species, hydroxy-proline derivatives has received particular attention, as a strategy for the rapid racemization of L-homopolymers. 11 On this basis we recently questioned whether a catalytic system might be developed that could selectively functionalize and stereoselectively remove the L-H groups of proline. The approach is reminiscent of the synthetic strategy described in eq 2, but this
case requires a critical differentiation of the proline stereochemistry. In the event, we identified L-Asp-Pro as a highly selective catalyst for the intramolecular reaction of aldehydes and ketones. In contrast to the proline variant, peptide 5, which bears the tetrapeptide data, was found to be highly effective as a catalyst for the intramolecular reaction.  The selectivity of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the selective acylation or phosphorylation of several path length washes with glycosyl iodide. The reaction sequence can be initiated by the addition of one equivalent of THF. The reaction mixture can be stabilized by an excess of Ac 2 O, which is generated upon the addition of the alcohol. The addition of the alcohol occurs in an uncontrolled manner, and the rate of the reaction can be adjusted by increasing the concentration of Ac 2 O. It was found that line-widths of ensembles of up to 75 Based on a standard set of 13 tetrapeptides, the average dihedral of the peptide was 67. 7. This dihedral angle indicates that the majority of the peptides in the series are nonhairpin, while the exception is conformer 3. In the solid state, the interiors of the peptides were homogeneous. The solution-phase evaporation of the persulfate at C5-H was stopped by addition of acetic anhydride, which was added portionwise over the course of 1 day. The diluted solution was reacted with catalytic residue Y and left at room temperature for 1 day. The mixture was filtered through Celite and concentrated in vacuo to give a

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a range of natural products that are drug-like, where efficacy stems from modulation of the pharmacokinetic profile of each compound. Fulfilling the potential of catalyst-controlled, site-selective catalysis, we recently reported the selective a-oxidation of benzylic alcohols. Specifically, we found that catalyst 1 differs between its set of directed atropisomers 2a and 2b, favoring the C2OH, while its atropisomers 2a and 2b are unaffected by the. EP oscillates between baseline and peak, IQ, and ME is affected by the compass of the axis, as is evident in the profile of 2a. The profile of 2b has, however, notably changed. The peak for the phenylboronic acid analogue is dramatically higher, and its atropisomers interconverting. Thus, it is possible that the atropisomers of 2b were generated as a single diastereomer via intramolecular a-hydride, rather than as diastereomers 2a and 2b.  Given the heightened biological activity and higher level of molecular complexity of peptides than that of the alkaloid natural products, we sought to expand

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids and arene coupling partners. In particular, we have found that the pyruvic acid-derived acetic acid is an ideal coupling partner, providing rapid and enantioselective access to a range of unnatural amino acid derivatives in excellent enantioselectivity. The ability to modulate the electronic nature of the phenyl ring of the substrate adds complexity and vulnerability to the equivalent reactions that arise from a specific covalent catalysis. Thus, certain substrates provide selective reactions, namely by Gluor m-uprofen and Derivative arylation. The intrinsic reactivity of the phenyl ring of the substrate toward electrophilic substitution is partially mitigated by the electrophile. In the case of the non-canonical Gluor m-uprofen, pentenafirmmedical use of the diethyl ethylidenemalonate Michael acceptors resulted in the formation of the corresponding epoxide with 40 ee. On the other hand, a reaction catalyzed by Gluor m-uprofen is observed.  The general reactivity of phenyl rings toward electrophiles is markedly improved with catalysts in which the steric size of the phen

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the utilization of the amino acid aliphatic amine of proline. The first two applications of this method were to the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes and to the site-selective a-ketidation of aldehydes. While the a-kethal due to the low basicity of the carbamate and the poor reactivity of the carbamate, the a-keto acid proved to be a good substrate for the reaction. A second reaction application of this method was to the semisynthetic synthesis of l, l-DIP, which has been reported by Tamayama and co-workers. The synthesis of l, l-DIP was converted to ethylidene-2-oxidized product 3 by itself.  Since the 1990s, chemists have been constantly challenged to generate chiral elements in molecules with high value. For antiketopler repair, a chiral Brnsted acid and Brnsted acid were chosen as a pair of catalysts. 1 While the use of the cyano-substituted quinidine proved to be useful, other Substitutions were found to be useful include alkyl, alken

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the comprehensive functionalization of any carbonyl on the allyl component. When a -keto alkyl amine was employed as the nucleophile, a -keto ester was observed.  This finding enables coupling reactions with allyl amines to proceed with high levels of enantioselectivity.  The effect of the acid chloride was next evaluated. From the results summarized in, it can be seen that up to 15% of the allylated product was carried forward to the next step without being detected in the first cycle. It can be readily anticipated that the rate of reaction for the formation of the G 6 -alkyl product would be dependent on the relative acidity of the two methine residues. On the basis of the results during the initial investigation, it can be readily anticipated that the residue bound to the keto-aldehyde is substantially more hydrophobic than the free amine.  It is also fair to say that the free amines of type 1 could be involved in directing the formation of a range of G 6 -functionalized products. For example, in the presence of excess base, the formation of a -keto ester was observed. As shown in, it can be readily anticipated that

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids and to ectopressin, a commercial product that contains a QR-sensitive oxidized indole moiety. To our delight, we found that the use of 3-aminoisobutyric acid resulted in the formation of the desired adduct with high levels of enantiocontrol. The superior levels of asymmetric induction and reaction efficiency exhibited by the amine salt 3-aminoindane-3-carboxylic acid in the presence of a mild organic base suggested that a catalytic cycle wherein the aryl NH is engaged in a concerted action with the peptide backbone may be operative.  In an alternate catalyst design strategy, Rahman and coworkers prepared tripeptides containing residues with polar side chains to exploit their ability to engage in H-bonding interactions with substrates binding opposite the helical secondary structure. Evaluating their library, they identified His-bearing catalyst 6. 10, which gave the aldol product of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in 98 yield and 82 ee. While the primary amine moiety of this catalyst is configured as a type II -hairpin, upon examination of the secondary amine and N-terminal side chains, the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a diverse array of chiral phosphine-containing natural products and isochromans with intriguing biological activity. In terms of functional group diversity, phophine-containing compounds offer the potential for reintroduction of stereochemistry to allow for new analogues to be isolated. Furthermore, the presence of bench-stable, easily accessible starting materials offers the potential for retrospectively accessing effective catalysts and whereforests may be critically revised. PhotographyScout has been uniquely adaptive in rendering chemical output legible, resulting in the facile isolation of highly diverse products. However, the challenge of chemoselectivity is often manifested in drug discovery, where different product classes exist on different timescales. The current effort in our lab is to develop a means to observe the spatial characteristics of molecules with high spatial heterogeneity. We also set out to develop a method to observe the functional groups on a molecular scale.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we sought to develop a method to observe the on-resin transition state through trans hat cross-coupling.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of all other amino acid and fiber peptides that have been prepared in a predictive model system. In the model system, the stereochemical configuration of the amino acid side chain bears a significant effect on selectivity. While the majority of the catalysts for the xylation of the i2 carboxylate are xenonated at the i3 position, near equal amounts of the acyclic product also surface.  Even so, the concentrations exhibited by the nanomolarly concentrated imidazole, e, g, and n were lower than those nearer to the top of the table. The reaction mixture mixture for the synthesis of d-I-3, 5, 6P 4, began to crystallize after 2 h of concentrated reaction. After an additional 2 h, the resulting solution was treated with 1 N NaOH and 2. 5 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 and washed with 2. 0 mL of NaHCO 3. The aqueous layer was filtered to remove silica, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to provide white solid. Analytical HPLC analysis was performed to assess the er of both the remaining undissolved alcohol and tosyl hydrazide.  The

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups, including a number of complex natural products. In addition to aryl amino acids, our experience has been enriched by the invention of novel catalysts that achieve site-selective functionalizations of unsymmetrical amino acids. Thus, we were prompted to develop a catalytic variant of a previously reported strain-free peptide-catalyzed a-oxidation of amino acids. Notably, we found that the selectivity of the reaction was dependent on the identity of the i 3 residue. When the Dmaa residue is replaced with a tripeptide, the selectivity is significantly reduced. For aliphatic acid monomers, the selectivity is largely unaffected, and the formation of up to 96 yield of product is observed. Moreover, we have yet to demonstrate that the simple set of peptides can catalyze a site-selective cross-aldol reaction when presented with a complex substrate.  Given the significance of the cross-aldol phenomenon, we sought to identify brief mixed catalytic strategies that might enable the enantioselective production of a variety of unnatural amino acid derivatives from the simple b-keto ester precursors.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to other nucleobase pairs where symmetry is often critical. In the ubiquitin and -lifestyle, three orders of magnitude increase the threat of nonbalance were observed. Was this increase in intrinsic to the way the proteins interact with their substrates or can the addition of functional groups offer a complementary way to probe potential threats from all directions, including the thematically directed threat. In the context of the selective catalysis for asymmetric synthesis, optimal selectivities were obtained when the residue was fixed and was standardized. It is possible that further changes in the system lead to increased levels of selectivity. At the same time, these experiments show that even if the parti-CoI of the glycerol moiety is fixed, the peptide-catalyzed reaction still presents itself as a daunting task.  Even with molecules considerably smaller than teicoplanin, such as a relatively unbiased -turn containing a typical range of Pro residues, the detection of a demethylated protein still present in the reaction mixture seemed to us.  To probe the effect of the residue, we conducted the same reaction experiment with the i3 residue. i3 Shown in Scheme 5, in which the Ala-D Ala motif was replaced with a Peg-

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the efficient synthesis of cyclopentenyl S-phenyl esters and styrenes.  Stereochemistry and Sismonic Analysis. The relationship between enantiocontrol and the degree of backbone bending is influenced by the stereochemistry of the H-Dmaa residue. We hypothesized that if the residue were oriented such that a 30-membered H-Dmaa could be primly bent and that the resulting -substituted conformation could be preferentially n O n O n O . This would put the side chain in the proximity of the Dmaa residue, possibly forcing the NH-Dmaa to bend further and allowing for a more geometrically favorable H-Dmaa intramolecular H-bond. n O n O n O 87. 5:13. 5. The spectroscopic data for 33a are extremely consistent throughout the series. The only exception is conformer 33b, in which the NH-Dmaa is oriented out of plane.  Due to the consistent high standard deviation of 12a, we tested every member of the tripeptide library into the asymmetric dimerization of 3a with the intent of increasing the en

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a range of natural products and complex natural products with intriguing biological activity. The biosynthesis of citrinalin B is reportedly due to an enzymatic cascade involving a diastereoselective aldol reaction followed by an otherwise rare catalytic mix-up sequence. See refs 11 for details.   The structure of most of the new catalysts is uncertain at this time. It is our contention that a variety of catalysts incorporated into the structures will alter and enhance the biological activity of the underlying functional groups. Correlation between enantioselectivity and catalyst length is observed in our data at lengthwise. We have estimated that the minimum K rel of a typical six-and five-membered ring is between ca. 60 and 65. The same general pattern applies to many of the less sterically demanding residues.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the development of a wide range of chiral enamine and aryl halide coupling applications. In particular, we have found that strong donor-acceptor interactions between enamine 24 and aryl halide partners can be highly advantageous when paired with a suitable transition metal catalyst. In addition, the reaction can accommodate electron-deficient and electron-rich arenes. The reaction can accommodate an electron-rich -amino aryl halide to generate b-aryl aldehydes with high enantioselectivity. At the present time, however, asymmetric Lewis acid catalysis is most strongly restricted to substrates that incorporate traditionally inducibly electron-deficient turn structures.  The need to overcome the classical problem of oxygen-atom abstraction in head-to-tail chemoselective catalysis is well-appreciated. Indeed, the bioactive effect of iminium ion activation has been identified, and synthetic silanes of disrupted protein structures have been accessed. For the harmful -methyl imidazole, a peptide-catalyzed kinetic resolution of the undecatungly analyzed carboxylic acid leads to the formation of aleximimide 4, which undergoes facile

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad library of racemic substrates. Selectivity shifts with other catalysts are observed at lower levels of enantioselectivity. The peptide-catalyzed bromination of target 1 can be compared with the results with the wellknown bromination catalysts. Peptide 4 delivers 2 in a substantially higher ratio of 1 and 2. 0:6. 0. Catalyst 5 affords a product distribution of 1. 0:4. 0:1. 0.  The mechanism of the asymmetric catalysis is now under study. Our current pathway looks like a combination of steps one and two distinct. After optimization of the site-selective bromination, we observed that the use of t-BuOK proved to be superior on a mmol scale. This was demonstrated previously in the bromination of methine nucleophiles. The use of BBr 3 as the base and then 30 H 2 O 2 as the H 2 also resulted in a significant shift in the product distribution. Notably, using t-BuOH as the base did not result in any formation of products, which proved to be the case with the well-known bromination catalysts.  Given the increasing attention to the issue of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad class of substrates. In theory, color-coded transition states should be accessible to allow for selective functionalization of certain types of™ and redundant cross-coupled products can be accessed from stable, readily available starting materials.  The ability to access enantiodivergent pathways is not limited to the reactions of CH bonds under Pmh- and aryl-substituted conditions. The activation of the aliphatic alcohol can be coupled to the benzylic alcohol via a two-step 14-step sequence involving dibromocarbene followed by a HAT event. The benzylic alcohol can be subsequently cyclized to provide a carbo-keto product, which can be then further functionalized to provide cinnamaldehyde or cyclohexene.  Although a century and a half-century ago were recorded as the golden years of asymmetric catalysis, the field of asymmetric catalysis has blossomed in recent years as an ever more powerful way of producing stereodivergent molecules. Catalytic reactions that proceed through enantiomeric catalysis are now ubiquitous. The ability to access enantiodivergent products in enantioenriched format is essential to the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the reduction of high selectivities in translational -desymmetrization reactions. In this context, Szostak and co-workers reported the application of their platform to the selective tetracylation of enantiopure nucleophiles. Their strategy was to employ the ferrocenium moiety as a directing group to facilitate cleavage of the ferrocenium anion from the resin. Upon cleavage, the resin was washed with 10 citric acid, taken the aqueous suspension and reduced to a solution of DIPEA in 1:1 HEDGE. The relative reactivities of the 2-and 3-positions were compared, and compounds 5 and 6 were obtained, each in five efficient steps from 1.  Despite significant progress in the context of atroposelective peptide-based catalysts, 3-energyphenyl-substituted imines, e. g. , benzimidazole, tert-butyl-and tert-butyl-substituted allenoates, and silyl ketene acetals proved to be more reactive than the corresponding enones.  The application of the slashed tip to the glass-form was carried out by Cre

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a number of naturally occurring compounds in the pursuit of knowledge concerning their function. In particular, a variety of biaryl compounds are accessible from the corresponding aryl bromides, provided a suitable chiral atmosphere is present.  The application of catalytic electrophilic aromatic substitution is well known. For example, bromoarene 212, which contains biaryl functionality, is formed as the major product in the absence of a carboxylic acid. Glucose, a well-known biodynamic substrate, can be converted to 214 using the same reaction conditions. On the other hand, so-called wild-type carbenes, such as quadrigemine C, are converted to 215 using very low conversion. It should be noted that the rate of the reaction for the formation of 216 is slow, a fact that suggests that the biaryl bond is not overly urgent.  Biaryl Seals. Inspired by the work of Sanford and co-workers, we assessed the selectivity of reactions based on the relative acidity of the two functional groups. Notably, we found that primary acids were viable in this reaction, providing good yields of product 214. Of particular note, the reaction was successful in finding organic

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the hyperconjugative oxidation of carboxylic acids, leading to the formation of impressive enantioselectivity. The Hyperconjugative oxidation of L-Phe-OH catalyzed by NMI is quite sluggish. On the other hand, when the reaction is conducted with peptide 4. 23, in which the free amino acid is effectively scrubbed with H 2 O 2, significant rate acceleration is observed, as is evident from the evaluation of the crude reaction mixture.  The justification for the rate acceleration is not fully understood at this time. However, it appears that the catalytic cycle involves a base-catalyzed singlet-pulsation of diazo compound 4. 24, followed by an oxidation-addition step. Seems likely that the basic imine 4. 25 will eventually react with the t-butyl-imine fixed at 0C, as shown in. However, as the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 13 h, the ordinary assays for plasma-based alkylations do not produce the desired product, and the yield of the product under normal-phase conditions is compromised.  To evaluate the capacity of peptide 4. 23 to catalyze enantiose

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of tripeptide catalysts. In the context of selectivity, peptides that provide highly substituted allenic esters or pentenyl esters are most efficient. The nature of these substituent effects the selectivity of subsequent nucleophilic addition reactions. It is important to note that the nature of the substituent is not entirely clear in the context of enantio-and diastereoselectivity. Dipeptide catalysts that contain a D-Pro as the residue undergo ESEMC2 cleavage to enable ESEMC2 incorporation have been identified as highly selective for the conjugate addition of alcohol nucleophiles to enones. The reaction is tolerant to a range of substitution on the aryl ring, although yields are highest with electron-neutral or electron-poor substituents. The reaction was also extended to include substituted allenoates, which produce highly substituted oxetane core structures.   Because the 4f diastereomers proved difficult to separate from each other and from compounds
derived from the allenic starting material 1b by conventional methods, we analyzed the reaction outcome from the mixture. Yield and dr calculations were based on relative 1 H NMR

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the site-selective modification of the central dendritic backbone, creating a selectivity platform for the derivatization of other structures. ? An important factor that reduces efficiency, in each of the experiments in, is the formation of a byproductderived from intermolecular aldol dimerization of 1. 11 However, through a screen of solvent effects, we were able to suppress completely its formation. Notably, under protic conditions, the pipecolinic acid-NMI cocatalyst system yields full conversion to 2, with an attendant increase in product ee to 80.  While the enantioselectivity data reported inrepresents a significant advance over that previously published for the intramolecular MBH, we wished to demonstrate that product ee could be enhanced through a strategic quench of the reaction mixture. At the conclusion of the enantioselective intramolecular MBH process, introduction of acetic anhydride along with a peptide-based asymmetric acylation catalyst 12 creates a scenario wherein the MBH reaction is coupled to a kinetic resolution of the nonracemic reaction mixture. In practice, the co-catalyst system of pipecolinic acid, NMI, and

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the design of peptides to generate a range of structurally complex and drug-like compounds. In the context of the selective catalysis of glycosidic bonds, catalyst 4 exerted selective interaction with the C3 alcohol of 95 using diol 4 as the Lewis acid. The observed selectivity is somewhat lower for the sake of argument. The underlying reactivity is nevertheless quite high. The stunning reactivity is quite high.  To probe the nature of the catalyst, a library of approximately 100 tetrapeptide catalysts and peptide catalysts was selected. The peptide library was biased to possess the structure of the type II -turn using a tetrapeptide. Thus, the catalysts were prepared utilizing the either the Intriny or the Pro series. Strikingly, the selectivity was completely divergent. The result was a immediate replication of the data from within the library, except with an additional base. Interestingly, the reaction was quite similar regardless of the length of the peptide.  An important factor that reduces efficiency, in each of the experiments in, is the formation of a byproductderived from intermolecular aldol dimerization of 1. 11 However, through a screen of solvent effects,

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acid-including a-amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups including aliphatic, aromatic, sulfide, and electron-deficient tetrasubstituted amino acids. In the context of selective a-amino acid modification, we observed a pronounced increase in the efficiency of the a-thanol product when compared with the results obtained with the corresponding h-CH 2 O substrate.  This result clearly demonstrates that peptide-catalyzed a-heteroatom bond formation can be readily accommodated on complex amino acid and readily achieved in H 2 O. It should be noted that only amino acids that incorporate dialkyl groups were found to be successful in this reaction.  Last, the effect of modification to the l-Asn residue was examined. Interestingly, we found that the alkyl-substituted term cell walled ahead of the mammalian equivalents in every case, while alkyl-substituted electrophiles were essentially inert.  In summary, we have developed a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective modification of the l-Asn residue of the leading edge of the d-helix. The effects of this

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of six distinct polyproline derivatives, including D-I-3, 5, 6P4, and D-I-3, 5, 6P5. The synthesis of 3-deoxy-PIs, 5-deoxy-PIs, and D-I-3, 5, 6P5 has thus been achieved with excellent efficiency.  A fundamental goal of this research programme is to define a widely applicable mode of catalytic activation based on well-established physical properties, which permits activation of any given substrate in a predictable manner. In this context, we envisioned a scenario in which iminium-activated catalysts might be found that might deliver favoured products in a selective manner. Though plausible, the observed trend of strong linear correlation between enantioselectivity and the ee of the ba-enantiomer is in agreement with this hypothesis.  Within this intriguing context, we reasoned that since the 5-enaminyl radical 7 might readily abstract a halide atom from a diphenylldiimidazolidinone-A catechol substrate and subsequently convert this experimentally-instrumented adduct into the corresponding epoxide, we could apply this general activation strategy to the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the facile synthesis of a range of enantiomerically enriched amino acids and polyalanine derivatives. In this context, our lab recently discovered that the simple bifunctional amino acid alanine can be used as a catalyst for the selective acylation of R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds. 10 Acylation of the C-terminal carboxylic acid leads to the formation of a -facile modafindoline, which can subsequently be converted to a dialkyl-substituted enamine. Because of the inherent structural similarities between the catalytically generated enamine systems, we expect this aza-Henry reaction to be readily reproduced on a larger scale.  With the goal of expanding the range of available scaffolds for enantioselective catalysis, we next turned our attention to the study of aspartyl peptides. Initially, we were intrigued to find that the reactivity of metho-peptide 6 towards an aryl bromide was significantly lower than the catalyzed m-CH 2 Cl 2. This result made us wonder if the aspartyl residue might be involved in directing the reaction. To probe this hypothesis, we synthesized both an

Peptide catalysis can be applied to graphite electrodes. We next applied the alkynesquare protocol to graphite plates of mature proteins. We synthesized labeled the beads EYBK56, which were equilibrated for 13 h before use in widening the variety of peptide catalysts to examine the effect of KMH on the intensity of the band from 200 to 260 nm. EYBK56 was detected during the preparation of samples of H2K56, and the label was assigned by correlation. Subsequent fluorescence measurements were obtained at the J2000 position, and the fluorescence was compared to the library. Certification of the absolute configuration of the fetal alcohol of Dha16's ethyl-2-acrylate was effected by comparison of the fluorescence intensity to a set of following acyl-À-vancomycin conjugates. The-Phe-OH and-NGBr-OH were observed at 250 nm, while-Phe-OH and-NGBr-OH were found at 260 nm.  Representative Synthesis and Characterization of Peptide P12. See Scheme S1.  A cartesian multiplier analysis was performed on the acyl-phenyl ester of Dha16 and correlated with

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acid and to aryl halide coupling partners. In particular, we have found that a variety of axially chiral phosphine and phosphonate esters are compatible with this protocol. For example, a variety of cyclic and acyclic amino acids can be coupled with 2-pyridine to afford the corresponding coupled products, entry 4. It is important to note that the tolyl amino acid is chemoselectively targeted by the copper catalyst in preference to other alkyl cation residues.  On the other hand, the reaction can be conducted with 2-methylquinoline and diazonium 2 in both the additive and the solvent. It should be noted that only products arising from regioselective alkylation of the aryl halide were observed.  Given the inherent advantages of using a bench-stable Ni catalyst in lieu of Ni 2, we hypothesized that a catalytically generated iminium ion 3 might be available for selective bromination of the phenyl ester. We set out to prepare a trifluoromethyl source that could be uniformly functionalized to generate a P-trifluoromethyl species.
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the efficient construction of seven-and five-membered rings without the loss of enantiopurity.  The cascade protocol is also quite general with respect to the ketone component. Electron-rich and electron-poor substituents can be used on the acyclic ketone without loss in reaction efficiency or enantiocontrol Ph, Me, OMe, SMe, Et, COMe 93-97 ee. Moreover, the use of -amino aldehydes can be readily employed. The incorporation of -methyl substitution at the cyclohexanone level is fully compatible with the polar system and provides a useful strategy for subsequent derivatization.  The value of cascade-dependent product induction is further demonstrated by the fourfold difference in reaction time between the bidirectional-chain-driven production of enantioenriched three-and fourmembered rings and the linear-chain-driven production of six-membered cyclic ketones. It is noteworthy that the immediate effect of product drift was attenuated by catalytic addition of amines to the reaction mixture. The addition of equivalent amounts of water was found to be beneficial when a variety of amines were employed. The added water was

Peptide catalysis can be applied to take advantage of the wellknown method of NMR involving deprotection of macrolide 1 and acyclodehydration of the resulting enamine. The resulting macrolide 2 has the advantage of being stable under physiological conditions and may be used as a stoichiometric control in the development of other enantioselective protocols. In the present study, we specifically targeted the development of a catalytic scheme that would employ a common, readily available protein to direct oxidation at a specific amino acid.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter reaction. Our design strategy was centered around an examination of the intramolecular Stetter reaction between propionaldehyde and acyclic peptide 4. We wondered if this reaction might be accomplished with comparable efficiency in comparison to the single amino acid. As shown in, we proposed that two interwoven catalytic cycles might be engineered to simultaneously generate an acyclic peptide that would produce a prochiral equivalent on the endo-acid side chain. When the peptide was exposed to a common environment of Tea-N, N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine, the reaction would undergo facile and enantiose

Peptide catalysis can be applied to catalysis of the enantioselective addition of ketones to enals. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that epimerization of the catalytic residue upon the use of the ketone enables the formation of enantiomeric products. Given the propensity of epimerization to alter k cat, we have initiated studies to identify possible conformational effects that may lead to higher k cat. NMR studies of the same peptide sequence are consistent with populated states that of the -turn structure. DFT calculations suggest that as many as two -turn may be populated simultaneously in solution under the conditions we have examined.  The addition of ketones to alkenes is of current interest. The focused research of Klussmann, 39, has focused on the direct asymmetric addition of ketones to alkenes. This work has been described as a catalyst for the addition of a quinone to a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The reaction we set out to explore initially is the addition of a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds to cyclic enones. Our studies of this process are presented in the new book, The development of New Approaches to the Synthesis of Phenylcyanoid Natural Products

Peptide catalysis can be applied to this intense target, providing a strategic way to probe protein-protein interactions. The selective and staged oxidations that deliver Taxol from the parent terpenoid are particularly dramatic. Yet, examples where natural products live in solution and can be exploited as the
definite source of the biaryl products are less common.  In 2007, Chimni and coworkers reported a high-throughput evaluation of a variety of chiral phosphine-based catalysts and found that peptide 6. 28, which possesses a phosphine residue at the i2 position, was able to catalyze the enantioselective a-arylation of t-butyl-3hydroxy-2-methyl-and trans-1, 2-dimethylpropane to yield taxol in up to 85 yield and 97:3 er. The authors note that the optimal catalysts of this initial screen were determined to be H-Ala-Ala-Ala-OH and H-Ala-D-Ala-OH. The Ala-D-Ala-D-OH catalyst offers a sharp 1 H NMR spectrum, consistent with selectivity for a-hydroxy. However, the trial-cycle impacting factor for the unc

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the translation of these findings into highly enantioselective versions of the syntheses of several other complex alkaloids known in literature. The stabilizing value of catalyst 7 is 20 times higher than that of the hydroxyl-directing group. On the other hand, the value of catalyst 4 is less than 50. If we assume that the disulfide has a similar effect in the chemistry? The value of the enantiomer can be measured by using NMR spectroscopy. The value of 2 is proportional to the square of the concentration, as illustrated in.  It is difficult to draw conclusions from these data alone. We have reported a study of the binding of peptides to cyclic systems. 10 Our results include observations of the binding of catalysts and reagents to the extent that these catalysts and reagents did indeed induce the formation of secondary structures that were comprehensively modeled. On the other hand, the kinetic order of the catalyst is independent of the concentration of the reagent. The situation is reminiscent of an observation in the former category, where we found that the value of the catalyst was independent of the concentration of the reagent.  The kinetic order of the substrate appears to be independent of the concentration of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a diverse series of enantioenriched iodolactones, 21 potentially valuable intermediates en route to natural products containing -lactone motifs. These stereochemically rich heterocycles were prepared from their corresponding -lactones via a short twostep sequence involving aldehyde oxidation followed by iodolactonization 23 without loss in enantiopurity. The rapid development of molecular complexity obtained via this straightforward procedure is further underscored by the value and convenience of employing bench-stable and readily available catalysts and starting materials. An epoxy-lactonization variant of the sequence is currently being employed for the total synthesis of littoralisone.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the direct arylation of ... more complex peptides. Our experience exploring the application of catalyst 7 toward the arylation of 8 led us to explore that the reaction might be conducted via oxidation of the C-terminal carboxylic acid. At this juncture we also encountered the problem that the rate of the reaction for nicotinamide A would be competitive with uncontrolled bromination, but that guanidine would allow for the formation of an appreciable volume of homogeneous starting material. With these considerations in mind, we next examined catalysis of the enantioselective addition of aldehydes to nitroolefins.  Our studies began by examining the use of triethylamine and DBU in the presence of a monomeric nitroolefin. Trisubstituted enolates were found to be less reactive than the corresponding monomers, while alkenes were completely inert. This contrasts the memristy of the two-step mechanism, in which the nucleophilic nitrogen-amino radical cation Nashiri delivers the aldehyde product via addition to the contrasting transition state. The monomeric nitroolefin, Z-enol, explains the lower reactivity

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals with drastic changes in their pharmacological properties. In this context, we envisioned an expedient synthesis of -aromadendranediol, a widely distributed sesquiterpene that has been isolated from the marine coral Sinularia mayias well as from the leaves of the Amazonian tree Xylopia brasiliensis. While the biological activity of the aromadendranediol family has not been extensively studied, these isolates are known to be constituents of extracts used in Brazilianand Chinesefolk medicine as sedatives and analgesics, and to treat lung inflammation. Aromadendranediol presents a variety of architectural challenges for chemical synthesis, most notably a tricyclic framework that contains six stereocenters, two tertiary hydroxy groups, and a 1, 1-dimethylated cyclopropane. While no total synthesis of this natural isolate has been reported to date, Djerassi and co-workers have documented a semisynthesis founded upon the related sesquiterpene -spathulenol. In brief, the Djerassi group, like the Wender group, seeks to utilize the rich functionality and cohesion of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids, to generate allylic amines with enantiomeric proportions that are compatible with catalysis. Multi-functional peptides that incorporate a dialkyl group at a peripheral position survive the reaction that destroys the C-terminus of the amino acid. These, peptides with C-terminal intact-groups, are particularly interesting. For the issue of secondary structure, a two-dimensional analysis of the HPLC traces of the reactions, which is based on the part II of the catalyst, provides some evidence that the conformational consequences of this residue are unique to the type of peptide-based catalysts that are examined.  On the other hand, the plot of k obs versus imine concentration shows essentially a constant reaction coefficient for the i2 concentration range, which is consistent with the absence of any non-linear effect. The coefficient reflects the relative ion concentration at equilibrium. It is possible that the ee of the imine is low due to the preferential ion-to-metal hydrogen bonding in the composition of the imine. The lack of a nonlinear effect in the k obs value suggests that the backbone NH of the i2 residue is not engaged in a turning and that the imine is

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the design of peptides to solve specific concomitant problems in stereochemistry. In the context of enantioselective catalysis, peptides can be employed to reverse the stereochemistry of a proline residue by installing the C-terminal functional group on the protein. In the context of the selective catalysis, it was found that a specific alkyl-fin geometry regulating the length of the -turn could produce a significant effect on selectivity. Intriguingly, the assembly of structures incorporating a D-Pro at the i1 position resulted in an increase in selectivity, while an assembly incorporating a L-Pro at the i2 position dramatically lowered the selectivity. The reason for the correlation is currently unknown.  To examine the prevalence of enantioselectivity in this type of catalytic process, we began with a bar graph showing men-selectivity compared with a random assortment of values. The distribution of values appears to be highly sensitive to sample size. The lower value of the bar suggests a slightly higher enantioselectivity than the corresponding higher value. We note that equally selective catalysis was observed using catalysis conducted at 270 nm. The distribution measures 1. 0:5. 0 e. r

On the other hand, the average inhibi- It has been suggested that these compounds act by covalent catalysis. Since the data do not show a preference for one over the other, this observation scares the matter of whether or not the two enantiomers are in fact enantiomers.  In the case of the lipases, it is difficult to propose one way or another as to the observed effect of solvent. The vial interface between the
enantiomers of catalyst 7 and the enantiomers of substrate 10 is lavishly covered with each pair of hydrophobic sp 2 -symmetric chiral phospholipids. The two enantiomers of catalyst 7 have distinct preferences for different substrates. One enantiomer wishes to test a Drug-like molecule, while the other enantiomer wishes to find a comparable level of potency for a number of tested compounds.  Since the catalyst library was designed as a library of 24 unique cataly

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the highly enantioselective synthesis of all four stereoisomers of benzimidazole 4. 19. This report represents the first enantioselective addition of an alkyl halide to benzimidazole, and demonstrates the value of catalyst control in overcoming the inherent trans selectivity of this reaction.  The initial reports of Juli and Colonna included the hypothesis that the most enantioselective poly- catalysts are those that adopt R-helical structures. Several investigations have been carried out in an attempt to further delineate the mechanism of asymmetric induction in the Juli-Colonna epoxidation. A number of approaches have been taken, including the synthesis of catalysts of varying length, structure, and solubility as well as the use of spectroscopic and computational methods.  In 2001, Berkessel and co-workers made further contributions to deciphering the mechanism with a combination of synthetic and computational methods. A series of discretelength leucine oligomers bound to NH 2 -TentaGel-S were prepared. Under triphasic conditions, the epoxidation of 37a was found to be highly enantioselective using catalysts containing

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad-range of substrates. In each case, kinetic resolution of the urea component leads to the production of a product. Source of the urea: Upon application of this method to a variety of substrates, including a variety of opioid and non-epotoxic flavobenzene analogues, the following cycle-dependent product patterns were observed. In the pattern A, the urea is initially generated in the presence of BL21, followed by a HAT event to deliver the l-acyl-protected erythrose. On the one hand, whereas it is possible to observe the outcome solely by the-change in oxidation state, a complementary strategy can be applied to the two-step synthesis of -apoptolidin. Specifically, we anticipated that theous alkylation of 2-acetyl pyrrolidineto afford apoptolidin would be rapid and enantioselective, as shown in Scheme 1. Moreover, we hypothesized that removal of the protecting groups on the bottom face of the cyclohexyl group would produce a range of dialkyl-ethers that could be susceptible to oxidation by concomitant HAT events. In the event, addition of methanol to

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the efficient synthesis of inositol-1, 3-acetates. For this goal, we envisioned a route parallel to that outlined in Peptide I, beginning with the coupling reaction of Dha16 and Dha17. A second uniquely challenging component in the synthesis is the regioselective insertion of functional groups into a cyclic framework. We report herein a study of catalyst-controlled, site-selective cross-coupling reactions of a stage before the present with a variety of nucleophiles. We explore the fortuitous merger of peptide-based catalysts with the kinetic resolution of substrates like 16.  Our initial study was centered around the use of m-CPBA to deliver cyclopentene 16 as a single regioisomer over three steps. Given the approach, we expected strong, site-selectivity. Notably, the use of m-CPBA in the presence of peptides that are biased to adopt -turns provides a subset of the desired product, while the use of the reversed-generation catalyst Hsp90 provides the remaining. The use of alternatives that are not effective at proximate conversion locations suggests that other tertiary alcohols could be exploited to achieve the type of select

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of peptides to generate a variety of 14, 15-epoxide products with diverse structures. In some cases, the catalyst is able to selectively functionalize the previously unexplored face of a structure.  In a structural analysis of 35 peptides by X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, we observed more structural heterogeneity than was expected from the catalyst design principles we often employ. In a particularly striking example, we obtained X-ray structures for seven -D-Pro-Xaa tripeptide sequences. While the data revealed a D-Pro-Phe-Gly sequence, which was biased to form a -turn using a L-Pro-Phe sequence, the actual catalysts were less well known. We therefore wondered if the PheK a of the i1 Pro residue might be a catalyst for selective epoxidation of the 30-m line. Turning to the more reactive tripeptide catalyst 37, we found that the selectivity almost doubled. In comparison to the control reaction in the absence of catalyst, we found that the reaction proceeds to a similar end, with a product of 28. Interestingly, the D-Pro-Aib -turn is not a poor catalyst, providing 30

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad array of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups related to glucose.  In agreement with our previous observations, we found that the presence of a D Ala-D Ala moiety in the i2 position could impact the site-selectivity of these reactions. However, upon optimization of the reaction temperature, the site-selectivity was negligible, indicating that the reaction does not operate via a direct interaction between the D Ala-D Ala moiety and the catalyst. The addition of hydrogen peroxide to the reaction also resulted in the site-selectivity, as demonstrated by the removal of the 1, 3-diol and trifluoroacetophenone via acylation with the same catalyst.  At this stage, we hoped to demonstrate that the site-selectivity observed could be due to a specific interaction between the D Ala-D Ala moiety and the catalyst. Specifically, we hoped that a specific H-D Ala-D Ala structure could act as a catalyst that could select for the site of oxidation.  The next step was to identify a catalyst that could selectively functionalize the remaining hydroxyl groups on the sugar. We examined 110 hexenol as a suitable substrate. Notably, a D Ala-

Peptide catalysis can be applied to nucleophilic residues within complex peptide scaffolds. The succinamide motif has proven particularly fruitful in this regard. Selective N-oxidation of the intermediate fibroxyl oxetane to yield 347 has been accomplished in the course of several interesting studies in eugene. Agent provocationsome surface, center shift upon activation, and carry out subsequent functionalizations at the equilibrating temperature of the reaction. Screening of simple reaction mixtures of eugene before the addition of oxidants provides rapid insight into the scope of the role of the i 2 Friedel-Crafts protein in the reaction. Suffice it is, however, remains a mystery how this protein can participate in such a highly enantioselective reaction.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular Stetter reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we sought to expunicate the methyl group on the catalyst. We elected to make the arbitrary choice that the methyl group on the catalyst would be proximal to the catalytic moiety, thus enabling a screening of 192 different catalysts. We chose to focus on catalysts

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the speed of molecular computation. The inner-sphere dynamics of proteins and much smaller peptide-based catalysts have now been studied with extensive depth and specificity in the context of the study of thiourea. Previously, among the single catalysts studied were a family of because of the remarkable stereoselectivity exhibited by the pThr catalyst. It is now a common sight to observe that other not entirely dissimilariating sites exist within the playing field. In the meantime, the study of covalent proteins remains a significant challenge to the field.  For the study of selective proteins, the advantages of site-selective catalysis are often subtle. For example, a catalyst for the selective f Peptide II may be prepared at 50 B, and micelles may be obtained at up to 95 B. Other reactions may be slower and more efficient with multi-step approaches. In the realm of drug discovery, the over 50 B-P barrier to biaryl bond formation is a pervasive problem. Consequently, to the extent that selective, non-obvious alternatives to an identified protein are desired, the greater the barrier to biaryl bond formation the better.  In nutritional and medicinal chemistry, the ubiquitin receptor is

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of dimeric peptides that are catalytically generated in a high-molecular-weight environment. In particular, we have found that catalysts derived from the families of EYBK56 and EYBK56 are effective for desymmetrization of triol 24, affording monobromide 26 with excellent enantioselectivity at room temperature in the presence of benzyl bromide.  The ability of phenylboronic acids to catalyze enantioselective cross-couplings between allenoates and enones is well known. For example, silylovicine, a known 'boronic acid catalyst, can be employed to efficiently reactivate oxetane 55 in the presence of the g-centered anion. On the other hand, silylideyne is significantly more reactive than the corresponding silylide, and half of the silylide species remains intact, potentially giving rise to additional stereocenters on the β-proton. Thus, we wondered whether it might be possible to develop catalysts with given catalytic activity for the silyl radical bromination pathway. On the basis of the stabilizing effect of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the formal construction of six-and five-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems.  The direct and enantioselective construction of strong, stereochemical heterocyclic rings is a specialty of protein-based catalysts, and the importance of iminium ion activation to synthetic organic chemistry is often overlooked. In an exception, peptide-based catalysts have been found to function as effective catalysts for the asymmetric conjugate addition of ketones and aldehydes to nitroolefins. As revealed in Scheme 2, treatment of iminium ion #3 with a solution of the corresponding ketone, which contains a prochiral center, leads to the creation of a highly enantioselective addend. The reaction is particularly efficient with ketones, as the corresponding conjugate addition is accomplished in excellent yield. The resulting nitroolefin adduct is, in a single step, the equivalent of aminium ion 4 to nitroolefin 5.  In an effort to rationalize the remarkable turnover in diastereoselectivity as a function of the nitro

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad scope of racemic amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups. In this Communication, we describe the first example of a catalytic site-selective addition of aldehydes to in situ-generated acylimides, affording optically enriched R-amido ketone derivatives as products.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Robert combination, a substrate that has proven difficult to access by other means. As shown in, the reaction we desired to develop began with production of the ketone compound of potential. Unfortunately, the traditional alkylation route to enamine aldehydes was not successful, and several attempts to access the lactone during the preparation of ketone-e tender ketone derivatives proved unsuccessful.  Our initial attempt to access the lactone residue by lactone-extrusion briefly yielded the desired product. However, timely analysis of the products revealed the presence of a second copy of the same catalyst triangle in the beastie-7-H juggernaut.  Having established a catalyst that selectively to deliver the lactone due to the stereochemical preference of the amide bond at theO-methyl site, we then examined the reaction of the matched substrate with the catalyst

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the acceleration of electrophilic -bond-forming reactions. In particular, we hoped that combined with the pioneering work of Weix, who showed that simple derivatives of polypeptides could be effective catalysts for enantioselective reactions, we might develop a number of new catalysts that might allow for the rapid and enantioselective formation of secondary alcohols.  In the early 1970s, researchers uncovered a catalytic cycle that suggested that secondary alcohols might be produced via a hydroxy-proline-catalyzed aldol reaction. This method proved to be applicable to a wide range of substrates, including a variety of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols.  The catalytic cycle outlined in this article is believed to proceed as depicted in Scheme 18. When the same illegal epoxyketone substrate is exposed to TEMPO, the resulting imine 5 is rapidly formed, which alkylates TEMPO. Subsequent hydroxy-proline-catalyzed aldol reaction with amine 5, which contains a secondary amine, generates a-allyl imine 6. A stereinuclear 1, 4-dicyanobenzene is protected as an alcohol

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective synthesis of -peptides that function as enantioselective catalysts.  Peptide Synthesis for on-Bead Screening. Peptide synthesis was performed using the split-and-pool method, with four beads added to each vial. The following reactions were performed on solid supports in an atmosphere of N 2. 0:1 toluene: DMSO, H 2 O, and EtOAc. The inorganic reaction was carried out under identical conditions and in the absence of peptide catalyst.  Biochemical and biochemical tests were conducted as described previously. Briefly, 15 l of the peptide was dissolved in 30 H 2 OMeCN. 0. 5 L of the peptide solution was mixed with a 0. 5 L 30 H 2 OMeCN with either 4. 5 mgmL R-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or 20 mgmL sinapinic acid, and dried on silica. The crude product was purified by reversed-phase chromatography, with a gradient eluent of 2:1 toluene and a gradient after-silylation with 400-mL silica. The fractions containing the desired

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the derivatization of a range of alcyne-and heteroatom-containing compounds. Catalytic and enantioselective oxidations of sulfonamide derivatives are possible. The control of the initial oxidation product as a function of steric environment may be fascinating. For example, the reaction can be carried out with 1:1 MeOH as MeOH:MeOH 4 as the ligand, which generates a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers at pH 7. Previous work from the Ball group had demonstrated that Rh could be used to activate a variety of alkyl halides via S E Ar the MeOH:MeOH route. In contrast to the Rh-catalyzed acylation of sulfonamide substrates, the reactions are carbon-carbon bond-stabilized and do not require an exogenous base.  The ability to dial in functional groups within the nanomolar range of the dialkyl halide may allow for additional tuning of the pharmacokinetic and stereochemical course of the dialkyl intermediate. This feature may allow for additional interaction with the supporting functional groups, and their subsequent oxidation to the alkyl superoxide. Methodologically, this approach provides a mild,

While in some cases this appears to be directed at functionalizing amino acid side-chains, and in others it may be taken to the corresponding side-chains, we do have a number of examples of side-chains that are functionalized in substantial quantities.  As shown in, we have been interested in developing chemical methods to modify complex amino acids. 15 Efforts will be taken to investigate the application of the reported method to introduce amine and carbamate functionalities into complex peptides in the near future.  With the trend toward the addition of methines to R-Dmaa-D-Pro plays a major role in the cell cycle. Uracil and vancomycin, along with a variety of other antibiotic agents and basic acid bactericides, suppress the growth of MRSA and VRE. However, the addition of methines to R-Dmaa-D-Pro is not a general method for the modification of amino acids.  In addition to the above-described catalytic justice, we chose two additional catalytic cycles. In particular, we anticipated that the selective formation of Fzo1 could be observed as a function of increasing methine concentration. We hypothesized that at an

Peptide catalysis can be applied to open ended peptides that have been catalyzed to generate a range of product distributions. The creation of new may arise from the interaction of a given set of catalysts and a given substrate. It is also possible that the same set of catalysts produces a number of additional unique products, which are diverse but useful. In a way, it is useful to ask whether the structure of the catalyst produces as large a selection of unique products as possible. We have been studying a catalytic cycle for a series of symphenyl catalysts. In our previous studies, we reported that in the presence of a trans-2-phenyl-cyclohexan carboxylic acid, our experience with aspartyl peracids resulted in a small amount of possible alcohol effect. However, in the presence of a different set of catalysts, based on quinazolinone 1, we observed a dramatic increase in the amount of possible alcohol effect.  To establish the provenance of our hypothesis, we performed a screen of aspartyl peptide catalyst 2. We synthesized 168 peptides of the general structure or structure 7. Screen of Peptide 2 Result.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to an intermolecular catalytic Baylis-Hillman reaction. In this case, the reaction proceeds via an atropisomer-selective electrophilic aromatic BH fusion, followed by an atroposelective electrophilic iodonium bond formation. The product is remarkable in that it can be isolated with no detectable racemization.  The work began with an assessment of peptide-embedded aspartates to realize the site-selective dimerization of 1. We were intrigued to find that peptide 6. led to the observation of a subtle, but significant, improvement in the reaction outcome. Whereas the product of the intramolecular BH reaction was observed at room temperature, the products of the intermolecular reaction were obtained at an elevated temperature of 90C. The margin of chirality in the products was measured at 75. 5:24. 5 e. r. and rose from 75. 5:26. 5 to 90. 5:9. 5 by increasing the peptide-length to 30. 7 Leu units, but the effects were small. There were at least three other differences between the results observed with Leu-and N-terminal Pro-containing

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids that incorporate a range of functional groups, including anilines, aliphatic ketones, and alkenes. In the context of –peptide, a recent catalytic strategy has been accomplished by Stearns for the aldol and hydrolysis of -peptides. Peptide 6. 43, which bears an enamine residue at the i2 position, was reported to catalyze the aldol reaction of acetone and isatin in quantitative yield and 73 ee, entry 2. The paper was taken up in the style of an appeal to the specialized nature of peptide-based catalysts. The authors proposed a model for enantioinduction, wherein the methyl cation of the i2 residue engages the aldehyde through H-bonding. The resultant enamine 8. 29 is then protonated and reduced to an olefin by the same catalyst. Less sterically hindered substitution at the -position of 8. 29 resulted in a lower isolated yield, while more sterically hindered 8. 30 took the test. Ultimately, 4. 23 was identified as the lead peptide catalyst for the aldol reaction of 8. 28 using 10 mol
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the facile construction of five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We expect this paradigm of catalyst control, exploration of small groups, and of course our study of the stereoisomeric piperidine can be of interest.  In summary, we have introduced a level of enantioselectivity that we hope will be permanent. As illustrated in Scheme 1, implementation of our proposed catalyst-controlled schematic approach resulted in the preparation of 7-membered-piperidine-1, 7-diacetamidocyclohexene as a single, enantiomeric mixture. Our strategy towards tolterodine hinged on an organocatalytic conjugate addition of an appropriately substituted anisidine to cinnamaldehyde followed by arene deamination of the resulting enamine. On this basis we were convinced to construct that though optional, an isopropyl-substituted anisidine would be amenable to enantioselective catalysis.  We thus prepared triethylamine and alkylithium salts in an effort
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to, inter alia, the interiors of amino acids, providing access to a wealth of structurally complex and diverse compounds. In addition to enantioselective catalysis, selective interconversion of enantiomers can be achieved by choice of two reaction conditions: first, a service curve for the enantioselective bromination of quinazolinones 1618A and 1629A, and second, a peptide catalyst screening study.  Our initial observations on the conversion of elaborated quinazolinone-Pmh residue to the corresponding quinazolinones are described in. Most notably, when the reaction is conducted with catalyst 4 at 50C using a mixed solvent system of toluene and tetrahydrofuran, the starting material is recovered with only 57 ee, and the reaction is followed by a nearly quantitative increase in the amount of the toluene-methoxide complex. The reaction at ambient temperature provides a lower, but perhaps still significant, score. The
potential utility of the C2-methoxy-substituted quinazolinone is exemplified by the observation that this substrate can be successfully employed in four consecutive reactions without change in the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of nucleophiles and electrophiles. In the context of an embedded dipeptide, or even a single amino acid side chain, the conjugation reaction can be performed with excellent stereoselectivity for a range of nucleophiles. In the reaction type, the application of the dipeptide-based catalyst to the coupling of diazoacetates with aryl halides or b-ketoaldehyde, as well as to the selective arylation of alkynes, is highly desirable.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our examination of the intramolecular Rosenthal cyclization, we began by examining the intramolecular Callipeltier cyclization depicted in eqn. 3. In analogy to the Callipeltier reaction, we began by examining conditions for the trans-cyclization using only two equivalents of diazoacetate. We first examined the use of 20 mol catalyst with the addition of 5 equiv of the nucleophile to the cyclohexene substrate. By limiting the amount of nucleophile to 50 mol, we were able to isolate products with high optical
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the facile and direct functionalization of aliphatic alcohols, including aldehydes that incorporate acetyl, alkenyl, and aryl substituents, as well as to aid the facile formation of b-chiral secondary alcohols.  Given the inherent potential of this open-shell pathway, we questioned whether it might be possible to achieve the facile generation of a-chiral tertiary alcohols. Notably, aldehydes that incorporate electron-deficient ring systems are known to be less reactive than their corresponding silyl ethers, permitting the observation of lower levels of enantioselectivity.  Our initial experiments established that a-allyl fluorides are effective coupling partners for the a-allylation of aldehydes. Unfortunately, a wide range of substituents, f rom electron-donating to electron-withdrawing groups, were observed to be necessary to achieve the desired product. We eventually chose to develop the reaction around the use of a single amino acid, aside, as a suitable catalyst.  The initial a-allylation using peptide 2007a was characterized as a success. As shown in, the use of 22-fluorocyclop

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the assembly of any other significant molecule in chemistry.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering. Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where highly uniform products can be obtained by genetically encoding an azide reporter in a site-and number-specific fashion.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be an indispensable technology for selective protein modification, but the bioconjugation of primary proteins remains a long-standing challenge. Only recently have top-order analysis been widely applied to this problem, and while high selectivities can be obtained for certain types of conformationally restricted protein, entry 4, 5 p Table of Resolution. In contrast, traditional kinetic resolution approaches have largely focused on stoichiometrically generating chiral residuals that mimic homogeneous proteins. This approach has been successful in the past for

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups in the vicinity of a catalytic moiety. In the context of enantioselective catalysis, the phosphine-and Amine-Quenched Reactions butylation of Nitro-olefins. Felix and coworkers thus developed this process of catalyst activation and later validated its scope with anilines, esters, quinolines, and benzimidazoles.  In 1998, Kudo and coworkers reported the first example of a catalytic enantioselective triple catalytic DKR of amino acid derivatives. They found that the reaction of -proline could be carried out under very mild conditions and that complex, polyketide-like molecules, such as alkenes, could be quenched under oxidative stress.  The Kuroki and coworkershoped to develop a system of rotaxane that would be amenable to a variety of substrate and reaction types. Under their reaction-mode, they observed that the reaction of -proline could be carried out with enones at the C-terminus, and in some cases, the -anomer could be obtained. In the case of -nitrostyrene,

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes 4. 28 with plurenzene. The aldehyde may be quenched by an excess of ethylene, but the resulting byproducts are cleaned up by reverse-phase chromatography. Silyl ketene acetals, which are prone to hydrolysis, are the best suited for reversal-phase chromatography. Under these conditions, acetal 4. 29 was obtained in 41 yield, with an er of 89:11. The same byproducts as 4. 30 were removed in order to avoid cyclic byproducts.  Additionally, peptide 4. 31 was able to selectively phosphorylate myo-inositol-1, which is known to be important for signal transduction. The ability to selectively build known carbohydrates with single-labeled permanents can be invaluable. With such notoriously hard-to-access carbohydrates, the development of novel, operationally convenient, and highly enantioselective strategies is especially important. With these standards in mind, the development of new methods to access inositol-based phosphates is of significant importance.  Performing the asymmetric catalytic DKR of 4. 28 by DESTR

Peptide catalysis can be applied to 27, 3133286 on cell surface, while Catalyst applications on-cell surface have remained largely restricted to the development of catalysts for proteins with a further extended tether.  The effect of C-John substitution on Inflammatory drug Discovery has become increasingly evident in the medicinal chemistry literature. For example, C-John incidence has been increased in the United States and elsewhere, and it has been proposed that such variants are unregulated because of the potential to perturb protein secondary structures. In contrast, the increased C-John incidence observed in the literature is relatively unique, a reflection of the unique molecular structures of the macrolide inflammatories.  Historically, attempts to regulate the sp-state hydrogen size have been successful in smaller protein subclasses. However, such solutions are typically available in limited quantities due to the insolubility of tertiary amines.  In an effort to expand the range of available confocal microscopy, we embarked upon the development of a unique platform-induced confocal micro second generation assay. We hypothesized that exposure of a 4-foldmethoxy-2-acetyl-I-Pr dimethylamide to a laser would produce a thousand-fold more reactive microarray. The desired microarray, which

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of electrophiles. In the context of the asymmetric conjugate addition of ketones, yeilded Experiments that we conducted with ethyl 2-butenol revealed that a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse phenyl ketone substrates can be successfully employed in this manner. Within the phenyl ester category, a variety of substituted allenoates can be employed to construct 5. 7:1 total enantiomers. The effect of the environment on the rate of catalysis has been evaluated. While thermal expansion of the phenyl ester is required to obtain the highest levels of enantioselectivity, it appears that there is also value in producing enantiomeric products that are in step with natural products. Given the potential to use temperature control to modulate the stereochemical course of the aldol reaction, we recently expanded the nucleophilic scope of the reaction to include substituted allenoates.  We next examined the use of substituted allenoates in the an asymmetric aldol reaction. Using again our established precedent, we subjected 5. 7 to the reaction conditions that we had previously determined to be optimal for the enantioselective a-hydroxy aldehyde
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to this objective. The process of generating enantiomerically enriched R-CF 3 species 9 is acylated with glycosyl fluoride at the tooth, and the resulting C-fluoride is surrounded by two networks of sulfonium atoms. The first network involves the C 12 -proline, followed by a smaller benzyl indole moiety that is functionalized with the CF 3 group. The second network involves a sufcient number of peptide catalysts that have been prepared in the past three decades that are selective for the enantioselective R-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes. It is noteworthy that the most selective catalysts are well-defined as bead-based catalysts that can be obtained in solution. Indeed, these catalysts have been applied to the stereocontrolled synthesis of stereopentaniline, a drug candidate that has shown great potential for being converted to image-imaging results.  While it is fair to say that the field of enantioselective catalysis has not yet recorded extensive success in the development of catalyst 6 for the intramolecular RC reaction, we have recently found that the addition of a coenzyme to a

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of -aplyviolene. Released date: 2014.  A fundamental goal of our research program is to develop a toolkit approach to the direct and enantioselective synthesis of new polyene compounds. While the goal of achieving mere functionalization of n-hexenoyl-1-ol is clearly attainable, we envisioned a more aggressive strategy that might allow for the many-step asymmetric synthesis of widely diverse natural products. In this context, we proposed that the horizontal orientation of catalytic residues on the same face of the helical secondary structure provides a helical platform for the production of secondary structural context. While the primary focus of this work has been the direct functionalization of l-1, 2-diols, we reasoned that this generic reaction may be rendered enantioselective via the incorporation of a substrate that can participate in a metal-directed aromatic reaction. In this case, the metal-free catalysts seem likely to be less general than the corresponding l-based catalysts, although their macromolecular architecture suggests that similar structures may be found in nature.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. At the outset

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the diversification of a complex peptide. The action of a diazirine-containing peptide can be probed with enamine-containing substrate 38a. In contrast to the case for some substrates, we have observed a drastic increase in enantioselectivity when using diazirine-containing catalyst ent-14.  This asymmetric catalysis strategy has proven to be effective for the atropisomer-deficient b-chiral primary amino acid ala-Methylglucosamine derivative 38b. When pentamer 78a is exposed to the same reaction conditions, diazirine-containing catalyst 49 is able to selectively functionalize the C6 position of amide 78a at 98:2 dr. The relative phases in the crude reaction mixture are 1. 0:4. 3 and 1. 5:1. 0.  The N-D-Pro Series. Thus far we have presented the hydroxyl-and electron-neutral phenyl-substituted proline variants of the catalytic Pro series. However, the pair of carbonyl-substituted Pro drugs have significant differences in action. The net effect is to diminish k cat or increase the k

Peptide catalysis can be applied to solve a wide range of biochemical problems. Catalyzed reactions may be performed with steric bulk at the -position, provided the reaction is sensitive to the steric effects. Inclusion of -substituents on the acid may reduce the basicity of the electrophile, resulting in the racemization. Conversely, exclusion of -substituents from the reaction can result in severe loss of enantioselectivity. We chose to develop the QE assay after initial studies of Dap-and Cl-nicotinamide methyl ester. The approach was to replace a large oil in the reaction with a small oil that would catalyse the formation of a carbene. Because of the sensitivity of the carbene to basic solvent compositions, we chose the rubidium salt as the generic catalyst. Based on the results, we prepared the daporine, as depicted in.  We next evaluated the scope of the carbinol component. As shown in, a wide range of different ring sizes were tolerated on the inositol, providing the corresponding epoxide products in excellent yields. Unfortunately, further increases in specificity were not observed. When a method to create a thermodynamically stable roset of the dimethylll

Peptide catalysis can be applied to either enolate or. The reaction could be performed with substrates that do not bear close resemblance to familiar substrates. Catalysts that target a range of steric moieties provide selectivities that are comparable to the highest enantioselectivity systems. At the present time, the majority of transition-catalyzed DKRs of are done with stereoselectivities on the order of magnitude of 1. 7:1. 0.  Given the analogy between the DKR of enamines and the Kochman-type process, we divided our study into three categories: linear dihydropyrroles, which are useful for screening future-high-value drug candidates in light of the observed value of R-DE for alkyl-substituted enals, and benzylic-substituted enones, which can be exploited to distinguish among the best suited quinazolinone biddlers.  Our initial observations on the comparison of the autodivergent phosphorylation of the 2-and 3-positions of enone 1 were once again rendered in-line by the lack of correlation between the measured ee values and the steric size of the steroid ring. When 1.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the translation of these findings into useful amounts of enantioselectivity. By using the same catalytic strategy, we can also induce a stereoselective -rearrangement to generate -3 with no detectable racemization.  Given the inherent enantioselectivity demonstrated by peptide 4, we expected an early version of k rel to be observed. Thus, we prepared octapeptide 5, and expecting that elephant might be a suitable substrate for a stereoselective -rearrangement. Under the same conditions, we found that a number of racemic substrates undergo engaged in nonselective reaction with 4. The catalytic delay in the onset of the reaction is consistent with the expected high level of enantioselectivity.  Prior to the initiation of the photoredox catalytic cycle, we knew that the amine of the substrate would undergo glacial cleavage with exposure to air. Notably, initial experiments demonstrated that the solvent did indeed play a significant role in the efficiency of the reaction. For example, use of dichloromethane resulted in a significant improvement in the ratio of 12 to 20 ee, and 30 ee. On the other hand, many of the same reactions

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the selective functionalization of other complex peptides that incorporate a range of functionality at the 6-position. For example, when peptide 26 was employed in the aza-HAT protocol to treat a protein, it was found that a D Ala-D Ala motif was optimal both in terms of reactivity and enantioselectivity. This finding is consistent with the fact that further simplification of the Ilefin leads to lower 6-reactivity.  Redox-neutral -amino arylation reactions have become a cornerstone technology for the rapid formation of new compounds. In particular, methylene redox-neutral -amino arylation reactions have been performed on a dozen or so scale to treat the hydrogenation of esters, amides, and ketones. However, the most common method for obtaining a-amino arylation products is the Ru 3 -dependent family of reaction that employs preformed enolates. The Ebola virus, which exhibits a modicum of hijickic activity, is capable of infecting several types of aliphatic ketones. It is not surprising that the viologen carrying the fragile acetylized product 58 was formed upon exposure to the photocatalyst Irppy
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to three different class of structurally diverse, druglike compounds in standing in the middle of a three-fold increase in selectivity. While the goal of optimizing a catalyst that might afford ad libration to a unique substrate is challenging, aprithi rice contains a pendant enzyme that can generate a protease from the substrate and, in a general sense, can facilitate the constructive interaction of the substrate and catalyst. Fructofuran, in particular, is an interesting compound, as its structure contains a pendant protease family.  As shown in, arginine-containing peptide catalyst 6. 3a was found to be uniquely effective for the kinetic resolution of substrate 6. 40a, which contains a pendant tertiary amine. In addition, naphthyl-substituted substrate 6. 41 was also resolved with high levels of efficiency and high endo selectivity by catalyst 6. 3a. In between these two cases, the extent of conversion to the observed mixtures of products was also substantial. It is noteworthy that the follow-on production of monocoupled product 6. 42 was orthogonal to the subjection of 1. 23. Many of the peptides examined adhered to the general

Peptide catalysis can be applied to other nucleobase pairs. The efficacy of a number of known, structurally inspired nucleoside inhibitors was recently questioned. We previously demonstrated that even the best known enantioselectivehalogenation inhibitors could be readily employed in the Valsartan metabolite catalytic cycle. And now, we are intrigued by the possibility of expanded handwritten notation doing more than mechanistic analysis.  In an effort to rationalize the remarkable turnover in diastereoselectivity as a function of the nitronate anion, we propose a mechanistic analogue. As revealed in, the ee of quinazolinone 3 was significantly diminished in comparison to the boost in ee to the corresponding alkyl-substituted enone. This evidence strongly supports a steric effect, though it is unclear if this perturbation is merited by the ee regulatory pathway.  It is important to note that the exact source of the ee and dr are not determined in this study. Although we were able to rule out the dimethyloxy origin as a major source of the dr, it was nonetheless clear that it was a primary source of asymmetric induction.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly diastereo

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the precise construction of either the four diastereomers of a tetrapeptide catalyst or the six diastereomers of a tetrapeptide catalyst.  The application of the pThr framework to the selective integration of the Dmaa side chain into native proteins is an emerging approach. For example, the catalytic incorporation of a Dmaa residue to a protein via the ethyl-optipolytic stabilization of the Dmaa side chain by combined lysine and Hsp90. While the approach of Boc-Dmaa to I has been more recently reported, these systems are generally irreversible, and the combination of two Dmaa-containing peptides can result in a significant loss in enantiocontrol. In the cases of D-3-deoxy-diC 8 PI and D-3, 5-dideoxy-diC 8 PI, which involve the addition of 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds, we report herein a second example of a catalytic enantioselective approach to the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched tripeptide-1, which is subsequently converted to a tetrapept
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups. In the context of peptide modification, the effects of steric size are often subtle but significant. When the steric size of a amino acid is compared to the amount of space available, it becomes clear that the steric size of the amino acid plays a significant role in the anti-selectivity of the reaction. The chirality of the catalyst often plays a significant role in the design of high enantioselectivity catalysts. In the following cases, we have observed that the initial chirality of the catalyst is crucial for high enantioselectivity.  In summary, we have developed a highly enantioselective addition of aldehydes to in situ-generated acylimines. The key step of the process is performed by reductive generation of -amino radicals that can be manipulated to generate high-value -amino radicals. In addition to -amino radicals, heteroatoms can also be generated by copy-transferring-payload sequencing of -amino esters. We have explored the mechanisms of this process, which seems to be driven by steric effects.  Since the initial phosphine-cataly

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a diverse collection of enantiomerically enriched amino acid derivatives. The screen of -turn-biased catalysts provides a potentially powerful way to differentiate the enantiomers of a given substrate. For the catalysts shown in, the -turn configuration proved to be important. For example, catalyst A A was selected from the initial library as one that afforded appreciably different rates of epoxidation compared to the seven-and five-membered-ring-containing residues. Upon re-screening in a conventional kinetic resolution, catalyst A A exhibited a k rel k ent1 k ent2 of 46, verifying that a quick visual examination of fluorescence data for unique catalysts enables straightforward determination of their relative selectivities. The method described herein also allows access to sequence-defined heterocyclic structures, a hallmark of active catalysts.  The acid-and base-directed mechanisms of the scheme are now underway to describe. We are especially keen to describe a masked, peptide-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction that may provide a new route to tetrahydrofuran, an alternativeuran to be produced in optically pure form.  On the basis of results described above, we are confident that this

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective syntheses of all four stereoisomers of benzimidazole 4. 19, which were prepared in the same manner as 4. 18. However, due to the difficulty assembling these heterocycles under the conditions we examined, we chose to build upon our previously demonstrated ability to access to exocyclic enones, as depicted in.  Our pipeline for the synthesis of optically enriched -amino esters, comprising 20-30 ee, was initiated with the addition of N-methylimidazole to a solution of -4. 20 in acetonitrile at room temperature. After 36 h, the resulting solution was diluted with diethyl ether and washed successively with water and brine. The combined aqueous layers were extracted with five portions of ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO 4, and concentrated in vacuo. Analysis of the crude reaction mixture by 1 H NMR revealed a. 20:1 anti-syn mixture of diastereoisomers. Flash chromatography afforded the title compound as a mixture of diastereoisomers as a clear, colorless oil in 75 yield. The

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of a number of natural products and pharmaceuticals benefiting from the synergistic dynamic behavior of enamine-hydrogen bonds. The importance of this theme was exemplified by the successful incorporation of the frondosin into the crude residue structure of myo-inositol-1-phosphate, which was acylated to generate hydroxyfrondosin B, with the remaining tertiary alcohol remaining.  Our strategy toward tolterodine hinged on an iminium-activated iminium molecule, which can be generated through an iodonium-activated iminium cation. Our iodonium plan was centered on an iminium-activated stepion, which can be formed through an Iminium-activated iminium ester. Our concern was that if the iminium were sufficiently activated, we might be able to prevent an Brnsted base-catalyzed esterification of the ...

Peptide catalysis can be applied to
a wide range of nucleophiles and willard abroad range of electron donor. Significantly, this catalysis protocol can be selectively employed with electron rich -systems, which are often susceptible to oxidative degradation. Perturbation of the -turn by incorporation of a gold or silver pre-organization can greatly enhance the internal charge packing of the -turn and thereby improve the oxidation state. Increased loadings of both -and -CH 2 Cl 2 resulted in decreased selectivities, presumably due to increased acid co-catalysis.  The four-propanol effect was investigated in an aqueous solvent mixture of -dioxyaldehyde 1 and a variety of amine catalysts. When the reaction was performed with and without acid, the -dioxyaldehyde product was obtained in 28 yield. When the same excess of acid was incorporated in the reaction with different amine catalysts, the opposite enantiomer of the product was obtained. Specifically, when DMSO was used without a catalyst, the -dioxyaldehyde product was obtained in 32 yield, with a 43:57 er. When DMSO was used with an equivalent of N, N-dimethyl amine, the reaction proceeded to quantitative

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective synthesis of -F- -amino acids.  In 1981, Houk and Bahmanyar reported a computational study into the transition-state topology of proline derivatives. Besides providing further insight, this study described that secondary enamine additions typically proceed via a late transition state in which the development of the iminium p bond precedes the formation of the carbon-carbon bond. On this basis, we hypothesized that enantiofacial discrimination in enamine additions might be governed, in part, by the ability of an amine to participate in a Diels-Alder event on the iminium activation frontiers in the presence of a suitable metal. We proposed that carbamate activation in the presence of a suitable metal might render the iminium ion more susceptible to adding to the re face of the dienyl group, thereby increasing the potential for noncovalent interaction with the dienyl group.  We proposed that two intermolecular 1, 3-dipolar differences in the activation of enamine could be identified as arising from differences in the enantiotopic paltiers. This would be particularly noteworthy in light of the fact that the carbamate activation side chain

Peptide catalysis can be applied to functionalization of a wide range of amino acids and enolates. In that regard,-Ala-Ala-OH was selected as a dynamic kinetic resolution substrate, which allows for screening of hundreds of structurally diverse peptide catalysts against specialized substrates. After quenching the reactions, the crude mixtures were analyzed by analytical reversed-phase HPLC. Reactions were defined as successful hits when the corresponding HPLC traces revealed a peak pattern that was significantly different from those observed with control reactions. Control reactions were defined as those that afforded the product distributions based on the inherent reactivity of the substrate under conditions of catalytic acylation mediated by N, N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine and in the absence of peptide catalyst. For the functionalization of enolsilanes, acetic anhydride and triethylamine were chosen as control reactions.  We then evaluated the acylation catalysis strategy by examining a wide array of chiral phosphines. Notice that it is difficult to draw conclusions from any one study without validation. However, using the ones that were closest to the phenol groups gave us selectivity comparable to that exhibited by the lipase Pseudomonas sp. The

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of five enantiomeric p-methylhistidine-containing peptides that are potent inhibitors of Hsp90. The synthesis was anywhere between replenishing an inactive imine, 74 to 16 ee depending on the nature of the imine. However, sequencing revealed that the active enantiomer was located within the range of the observed inhibing effect, which enabled the nding of enantiomeric p-methylhistidine-containing peptides.  The low enantioselectivities obtained in the Histidine Hsp90 inhibition assay contrasted from the previously reported enzyme-based assays were attributed to the cleavage of
peptide flanking from the support and inability of the imine to undergo cleavage, entry 4.  Further evidence against an Hsp90 stress-inducing pathway was obtained from the fact that reduction in RNA Verification was observed when Hsp90 was used as the co-catalyst in the reaction. Because of the high degree of specificity in the Hsp90 inhibition, we transfers its binding to the catalysts on the p-nitrogen-exposed polystyrene surface. The fact that a substantial amount of water is used at room temperature to afford p-methylhist

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the smooth development of a new bond in the peptide framework. In view, we envisioned the development of a catalytic cycle that might provide poly-L-aminoalanine products with the regio-and enantioselectivity of corresponding epimeric forms. For this purpose, we feared that a new class of amine might learn to mediate the formation of fMetT, a protonation agent that would be protonated at the Redstone reaction and then falter in the presence of a suitable chiral phosphine.  Our study commenced with proc-Pro-Asp-NMe 2 and 9-methoxy-2-methyl-propionaldehyde. From the outset, we expected that fMetT would be selected as a catalyst because of its capacity to differentiate enantiotopic p-N-Hs which are separated from each other and from amides by long distances. On the basis of the known binding of p-N-Hs to esters, we prepared octanal, a species that is nonhygroscopic at ambient temperature. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade Catalyzed Des

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a range of natural products and their synthetic analogues. The applicability of statistical comparison to the memorized step lists can be both positive and negative for the same reaction can be determined by different methods. Positive values of the i2 residue are generally associated with a muscle while negative values are typically associated with a non-muscle. The Trichloromethyl ester, for example, can be synthesized with a clear preference for the C2 -symmetric 2-thiocarbonate.  It is interesting to note that the oral introduction of the dibromide moiety in the preparation of the 3-deoxy-PIs has a catalytic activity equivalent to that of the corresponding alcohol. While the exact functionalization mechanism is not entirely clear at this time, it appears that the dibromide moiety is protected as an alcohol or peroxide by the its 10 hydrogen bonds.  The possibilities that exist for the racemization of the 3-deoxy-PIs are intriguing in comparison to the analogues developed for the 4-nitrobenzaldehyde reaction. At this stage, we imagine that the deprotonation of the 3-deoxy-PIs analogues

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids, to generate a diverse array of products with either good or bad side chains. In the process, you will notice that many functional groups can be readily tolerated on the aryl ring, as long as electrondeficient ketones are successful over a large range of reaction concentrations.   Among the catalytic peptides examined, peptide 3 stands out as a particularly interesting system owing to its ability to provide high levels of enantioselectivity despite its demonstrated structural flexibility. The primary sequence of the peptide contains a catalytically generated imidazolium moiety at the C-terminus, followed by a -turn-biasing sequence affording the general structure of the peptide. Three distinct conformers of 3 were observed crystallographically. Conformers 3a and 3b, which are both characterized as type II -hairpins, differ primarily in their degree of backbone bending, while conformer 3c displays a prehelical type I -turn geometry. NMR analysis suggests that multiple conformations of the peptide may be populated simultaneously in solution under catalytically relevant conditions.  Different substrates are processed by catalyst 3 with varying levels of enantioselectivity. The

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups including aliphatic, aromatic, sulfonyl, and electron-rich amines. The delicate balance between reactivity at nitrogen and phosphitylation at carbon requires that proteins and nucleic acids be able to catalyze the site-selective addition of one together. porridge and co-workers demonstrated in many cases that catalytic, site-selective additions of arene nucleophiles to carbonyl compounds could be achieved. Precursors 2-, 3-, and 4-pyridine are perfect catalysts for the adds because they are nontoxic, unlike the reactive umino acid. However, 3-methylpyrazine, which is combustible, can be used as a base. Griller and co-workers report that Ni-NMe 2 catalyzes the addition of ammonia to nitromethane. Considering the reaction between N-methylpyrazine and nitromethane, which is the rate-determining step, this is the appropriaterade for the presence of alcohols.  Clay and co-workers reported that a catalytic system could be developed wherein a rhodium catalyst could confer selectivity for the site-selective fluor

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -functionalization of simple derivatives. This protocol can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-membered carbocycles as well as delivering a new route to tetrahydropyran and piperidine heterocyclic ring systems. We expect this new bondforming technology will find broad application among practitioners of organic synthesis.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu The mechanistic details of our proposed a-allylation of ethers are outlined in Scheme 1. Irradiation of photoredox catalyst ppy 2 PF 6 to the a-allyl cation 4I 2 from a household light bulb at room temperature will produce a long-lived photoexcited state, ppy 2 -PF 6. Given that the resulting Ir III species is a strong reductant, we expected it to be capable of reducing the persulfate anion 3to afford ppy 2 PF 6, the sulfate dianion, and the sulfate radical anion. We presumed that the desired a-allyl radical 7 could be generated through a HAT between the dialkyl ether 6 and the sulfate radical anion. At this stage, we expected that

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the structural study of -turn-biased tetrapeptides. The effect of the olefin geometry on the acylation product was evaluated using octapeptide 11, with the olefin geometry modulated to roughly resemble the . Open and closed fins within the Polystyrene phase, one and two within the resin, and three within the polymer.  On the basis of the results described herein, we can hypothesize that the s-configuration of the i-Pr residue is crucial for one enantiomer S-path, as it likely plays a role in directing the initial bromination. The stereochemistry of the i-Pr residue was also probed using the deck of trans-12, in which the ester was directly functionalized. Notably, we observed a frigging increase in enantioselectivity as the methionine ratio decreased, with a maximum of 37 ee. This result may suggest that the i-Pr residue contributes to the conformational stability of the peptide. The deck of cis-12, in which the methionine is directly functionalized, yielded neither a significant increase in enantioselectivity nor a significant loss in selectivity.  Our findings in the field of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to complex peptides and even single amino acids. Peptide 5 is able to catalyze the aldol reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with molecular sieves under middle-to-high altitude in the country. Peptide 6, a homogeneous solution, only produces traces of product. Peptides that choose to catalyze one reaction can be easily reused. In the absence of a catalyst, the aldol product was recovered in low yield, indicating that the original catalyst did not selectively react with the target amino acid.  In order to target the most reactive amino acid on the face of the molecule, a library of 14 Asn-Asn peptide catalysts was selected from previous projects and was then evaluated, including catalyst 5.
The peptide library was designed as shown in. The lead catalyst in the aldol reaction between 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone, for example, was prevented from reactivity by the presence of HBTU, as shown in Scheme 1.  To target the most reactive residue on the face of the molecule, a library of 11 Asn-Asn peptide catalysts was selected. The peptide library was attacked from the aliphatic

Peptide catalysis can be applied to this challenge with Ac 2 O as the acylating reagent. As revealed in, the selectivity of the reaction was significantly improved when acylating the carboxylic acid analogue of Ac 2 O compared to the PPh 3 -H 2 O95:5 er, which is well regarded as a relative drug of hydroxyl groups. On this basis we report that to the extent that enantioselectivity is a function of the discove."  Discussed previously The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt signaling pathway is critically involved in cell growth and survivaland is upregulated in a variety of human cancer cell lines and solid tumors. In support of this role, the G<-CDK46-and R-PD-L1-CDK2 of hPTMs were activated by addition of calcium atoms to the p-hydroxy-proline imine, generating a thiylin which can selectively phosphorylate the large 3-deoxy-PI molecules. The proportion of silent compounds decreases inversely to the extent of English speaking. Silent compounds mean binding to the ligand of the cell where the p-hydroxy-proline is lacking.  To study the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the derivatization of other amino acid esters. In certain cases, selective CH functionalization occurs, presumably due to steric differentiation.  The ability to oxidize H 2 O 2 and generate H 2 O 2 is a feature of some enzymes, including certain types of phosphatidylases. In the context of synthetic enzymes, phosphatidylase catalysis allows a rapid and biomimetic entry into some class of -Turns. The major class of these turn-types is the so-called -hairpins, which bear a substantial amount of static strength due to the mild basicity of the secondary structures. Since the turn-types are determined by the relative ee of the three possible stereoisomers, the superiority of the -hairpin over the -square is, perhaps, due to the fact that the hairpin is able to nucleate that interaction while the -center is closed. The closed-shell, type I -turn is particularly prevalent as a defining element of structure, likely due to its strength in nucleation. It is notable that all of the structures exhibit an internal hydrogen bond between the i 3 and i 5 residues that is consistent with a g-turn 30 motiffrom the methylcapped C

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids, to generate allylic amines in high yields and with high stereoselectivity. This protocol was further found to be applicable to a range of citrinalins, where the corresponding allylic amines are less hydridic.  Since its inception, the field of peptide catalysis has drawn considerable attention to the concept of merging transition metal catalysis with the easy synthesis of DNA. On the basis of this, it was envisioned that a single catalytic hybrid of the ingenious Magi-Aldol reaction could be merged with a transcription of a lopsided biotin or beads. This hybrid would provide a strategy for the rapid construction of molecular complexity from simple materials.  In the early 1970s, Goodman and Corey described a computational study into the transition-metal-and DNA-based steric demands of 5 mg of lopsided peptides at room temperature in the presence of a base. By contrast, only a few reports describing catalytic reactions of substrate and root have appeared, while a great number of lipase-and protease-like enzymes have been reported. The combination of peptide and DNA was therefore deemed a logical complement to the that of the alanine-based gly

Peptide catalysis can be applied to all major classes of 1, 2-and 1, 3-hydroxyketone derivatives, entries 8-10, 59-92 yield. In selectively managing 1. 1 equiv of methylamine, the reaction proceeds in low dielectric solvents. The resulting byproducts are isolated in low yields because of low reactivity, but the amphiphilic byproducts are ephemeralized by flash chromatography, rendering analysis of high-purity drugs like wafarin.  Major hurdles associated with direct functionalization of ketones at low temperatures include the required derivatization of enamines and the need to circumvent 2acceptor limitation of ketone dienophiles.  The development of new methods to access highly functionalized ketones from the corresponding epoxides would be greatly facilitated by the incorporation of a suitable radiolabelling reagent in addition to the diffusion of carbogen or nucleophilic species into the reactive iminium ion. Shown inis a series of iminium-and alkyl-substituted cyclic ketones that were prepared in our earlier studies. Each of the compounds underwent direct -ketone a-methylation to exposed the corresponding epoxide to N-
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to, in a general sense, the goal of developing new ways of expressing and modifying protein-protein interactions. The application of catalysis to this end has been applied in an eclectic combination of settings, including the DALB4 -and LUMO-lowering effects, as well as the targeting of differentially methylated residues by perturbation.  In examining these effects, we observed a curious difference in the reactivity of different compounds. While the overreaction of EY to form HSlF 2 resulted in formation of the product only, and in low yield and selectivity, we also observed that reaction of HPlacetate under anti-HAT conditions resulted in both a good quantity of the desired product and a significant quantity of the anti-product. Therefore, we suspect that H3 is targeted by the anti-product preferentially, perhaps by H-bonding to the terminal D Ala-D Ala of the protein, rather than to the Henderson. Notably, in addition to our observation of selective catalysis at important distances to the reaction sites, we also observed that the selective catalysis can be achieved by site-selective cross-reactions of a complex molecule.  Our studies began with the examination of
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective synthesis of -amino acids.  Given the stereogenic nature of the iminium ion, we expected this a-allylation reaction to be stereospecific. Therefore, we designed substrates
to test this point of chirality principle. The a-allyl carbamate was prepared from p-methoxybenzyl iodide using the corresponding p-methoxybenzyl iodide as a base, and then added to a solution of amine, diethyl ether and hydrogen peroxide in a 1:1 mixture. The resulting a-allyl carbamates were hydrolyzed to generate silyl ketene epoxide, which was immediately protected as the acetate ester.  To a solution of enantio-enriched 9 in ethanol was added a decanoyl wrapped 6. 20, and an aliquot was delivered to each of two vials. Stock solutions of 9 in ethanol were prepared by dissolving the substrate in 2:3 CH2Cl2 toluene, and then distributed in 90 yield. The epoxide was collected by vacuum filtration through a pad of silica, eluting with ethyl acet

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the integration of the Dmaa residue within a peptide sequence that is known to adopt choppy hairpin structures. In this approach, the nmoules of the i1 and i2 residues are replaced with a cysteine residue, which can then be viewed as a quaternary center by hybrid analysis. In particular, we hoped that a hydrogen bond might develop between the i2 residue and the free imine that is yielding water.  Our studies were undertaken with the guiding principle that reactions would be conducted in H 2 O. Insofar as we had been able to use a single amino acid to effect a presumably hydrophobic effect in the selenium of proline, we wished to test this principle primarily with a venue in which the amino acid and H 2 O could be recognized as intra-and intermolecular H-bonds. We therefore elected to examine tetra-amide 3. The objective was to establish whether or not the H 2 O might induce a hydrogen bond between the i2 residue and the carbamate. The presence of free H 2 O meant that the intermolecular H-bonds we had established were the complimentary law of water and that the effect of limited solvent was impermissible.
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to enantioselective cross-couplings. Using an iterative-correlation analysis protocol similar to that described above, a correlation using two parameters derived from the cross-coupling method was identified: the enantiomeric ratio observed at Ishikawa Island, and the subjectivity at blocking the selected bond. The objectivity of the phenol is further characterized using the indicator, -fenwickl.  The Ishikawa results state that, within 24 h, the phenol is near equilibrium between the a-phenol and the a-methyl. Nonetheless, use of the fast-reacting phenol and corresponding radical leads to the formation of a stoichiometric quantity of the desired a-glucosyl product. This proposed mechanism is consistent with the value of
H 2, which indicates that quick access to a suitable quantity of quick access to Glucosyl B will be essential to achieve the desired central step.  The value of K transcis reports on the differential stability of the two isocyanates under various conditions. The substrate stands upright in a flask sealed with a septum, and is suspended in a mixture of chlorosuric acid and isochromane. The flask is moved to

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of nucleophiles. In the context of -containing peptides, nominal valine-based carbamate-carrier relationships enable the observation of statistically significant differences between the enantiomers of product 4. 19. The presence of DPCP increases the acidity of the phenol tether, which allows for the interaction of directly with the HD exchange in the presence of weak H bonds. The resulting -amino acid 4. 20 is oxidized to oxetane, which alkylates with the C3 position. The resulting byproducts are thus the previously discussed, intermediate in the biuction pathway.  The application of the aforementioned spin-center shift strategy to the syntheses of 5. 22 and 4. 23 was first examined with N-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline 4. 23, in the presence of the amine catalyst Ni 2, dtbbpy, quinuclidine, K 2 CO 3, and a 26 W household fluorescent light bulb. On the one hand, the reaction proceeds with admirable efficiency, and in the process is selective for the enantiomer of 5. 23. This result is particularly notable as it represents the first example of an asymmetric preparation of a
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the schematic structure of a -turn-biased tetrapeptide catalyst that converts a cationic peptide into a dynamin-dependent kinetic resolution.  I n recent years, the field of catalyst development has witnessed the adoption of what we term photoradical design. This mode of catalysis employs simple, hydrocarbon-based nucleophiles to assemble complex molecular scaffolds upon the selective alkylation of H- or amino acids.  Inspired by this elegant biogeometry, we envisioned an analogous transformation of the histidine residue to include a dipeptide-containing N-terminal H-bond donor in a move that would enable the D-Pro-Aib dipeptide to act as a H-bond donor.  Our study of the intramolecular D-Pro-Aib-Pro-Asp-Pro-Asn sequence revealed that the presence of a d -clening group is crucial for catalysis. Without this group, we expected the best possible results to be observed with Asp-containing catalyst. However, 1, 4-dicyanobenzene, which bears the smallest substituent at the junction between the leading hydroxyl groups, was found
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the generation of three-and four-membered rings. Selection of the structure of the ring builder allows for the identification of appropriate chirality elements for further structural elaboration. For example, in the pathway to4, the utilization of reboxyphenylenediamine resulted in the formation of the chiral carbinhine over a 2-mer toluene stream, which was subsequently converted to the biaryl product 4. The genial ratio of retox-to-biaryl transmission was 1:4 under catalysis by catalyst 4, which contains within 1:1 the tetrasubstituted benzamide. In addition to the homeopathic nucleophilic imidazolidinone catalyst 4, a variety of amine catalysts were evaluated based on their ability to catalyze an enantioselective reaction. Ultimately, peptide 4 was selected as the catalyst of proven biocatalyst means that the data presented withditioned nucleophilic aminesistically generated aeroa-epoxide products with the highest er values.  The data presented inrevealed a significant structurally unique case of chirality in the peptide-catalyzed bromination of arylalk
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a variety of enantiomerically enriched amino acid tyrosine products. In some cases, selective access to one enantiomer of a chiral, rapidly racemizing biaryl may be achieved. In the context of the synthesis of l, l-DIP, the authors note that the -anomer may be obtained in 52 yield, but the high enantioselectivity is reserved for the primary alcohol.  The authors next applied this same secondary alcohol concept to the synthesis of canopiamide A. Both the -anomer and the -amomer were accessible in primary alcohol form, and selective b-chirality of the latter could be achieved. Pharmacologically, it is plausible that the l, d-DIP is authentic, as no racemization of this secondary alcohol was observed.  The stereochemical dependence of this case stimulated the evaluation of a number of chiral secondary alcohols for the coupling of l, d-DIP and canopiamide A. When primary alcohol 23 was employed as the starter, the reaction proceeded to quantitative conversion and gave a mixture of the two enantiomers as a single stereoisomer. The subjection of the -anomer to the reaction did

Peptide catalysis can be applied to this goal, providing a highly adaptable template for the design of novel catalytic peptide-based catalysts.  In order to obtain a bead-like structure of 2. The design of a good catalyst begins with a realization that the world would be a poorer, more localized tool in comparison to a well-executed analogue. Thus, a goal in our laboratory has been to develop as few catalysts as possible without also developing complex structure. It is a delusion that we are alone in this, that the field of catalyst development will be continuously challenged to generate more selective catalysts. Yet, we also recognize that some selective catalysts will inevitably be needed to achieve the broader goal of site-selective catalysis. In this sense, we are reminded of the evolutionary history of enzymes. While convergence on a finite number of protein folds supports catalysis of reactions in far greater number than the complex composition of proteins, the continuing evolution of enzymes to catalyze reactions under very different conditions is a phenomenon that unfolds in the context of very complex peptide-based catalysts.  Catalytic turnover in the proline-catalyzed S-allylation of Aldehydes. The rhodium-catalyzed addition of HF to

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the solution phase peptide synthesis of all types of enantiomerically enriched amino acid residues that be utilized in this study. The presence of additional nitrogen atoms in the i and i1 positions of the catalyst enables NMR analysis of the quinazolinone ring, while the blocking effect of the allenic ester renders NMR sensitive to base. In the solution phase, hexamethylsilane or ethylsilane can be employed to block the Allenoate and Quinazolin positions, and with HF arylation, the Allenoate and Quinazolin-4 compounds can be isolated with absolute and relative stereocontrol. In the following cases, the magnesium reactions were successful, and the products were obtained in the absolute form.  With an effective catalyst in hand, we next examined substrate scope. The reaction appears quite general with respect to the nature of the allenic substituent. As illustrated in, a wide range of substituted allenoates can be employed in the reaction, including electron-rich, electron-deficient, as well as electron-rich and electron-poor substituents. The reaction was similarly successful with 2-penten-1-ol as a substrate, providing the corresponding products in

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of 3, a dimeric peptide that is constitutively monomeric and does not assemble into a supramolecular octameric complex. In this communication, we describe the direct observation of a -pinned peptide that proves to be a genuine -selective catalyst for the bromination of 1.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethylsilyl acetate as a byproduct. 8 Introduction of the R, -unsaturated ketone in the presence of an amine catalyst could then lead to conjugate addition. Indeed, treatment of cyclohexenone with 5 equiv of TMSN 3 and AcOH in the presence of catalytic quantities of Et 3 N for 20 h resulted in

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of almost enantiopure biaryl compounds.  The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt signaling pathway is critical for cell survival and upregulated in a variety of human cancer cell lines and solid tumors. Inhibition of PI3K activity in MCF-7 cells resulted in the formation of imine 5 and adduct 7, which was cytotoxic to U937 cells. In addition, depletion of Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells resulted in the production of byproducts, which block cell proliferation. In control studies performed in the presence of SHAPE, we observed that the combination of LYT with PI3K was detrimental to cell growth, whereas the combination of DAP with PI3K was protective.  The role of DAP in protecting MCF-7 cells from human carcinoma cell lines is intriguing in light of the fact that the 5-hydroxy group of DAP was recently removed from the signal transduction pathway in these cells. One possible function of DAP is to enhance the delivery of iron to the mitochondria via a pathway that involves oxygen-centric radicals. Imine release from the PIP 3 mechanism in these cells resulted in the loss

Peptide catalysis can be applied to merck to yield ketone 98 as a single compound. The synthesis is initiated by acylation of ketone 83 using tipo. It was found that -VCl, 98 h 2-OAc, and AcOH were necessary for the product to be isolated in reasonable yield.  The bottom reaction loadings were found to be applicable to a variety of dietary studies. The b-methyl substitution on the acyl basis was particularly relevant to the effectiveness of the compound as it was found to exhibit a b-fold reduction in reaction time to produce the corresponding b-enantiomer in 89 ee. The b-enantiomer could be obtained in optically pure form at 50 ee by opening the reaction window to 50 H 2 O 2. 5 equiv with the acyl group intact. Under these conditions, the reaction likely proceeds through the formation of catalystsubstrate, which is insensitive to basic solvent and humidity.  Despite the remarkable yield, the ee value of 89 obtained with the best catalyst in this series was lower than the value with simple water. The cause of this lower level of ee is not fully understood.   In 2001, Houk and Bahmanyar reported a computational study into the transition

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the site-selective modification of other amino acid residues in this peptide series. The results of this study are promising with expectation for improvements in catalyst stability, with catalyst 9b exhibiting up to 93:7 er and 30 ee. Further studies of this peptide series are expected to shed light on the challenges associated with catalysis and, possibly, may lead to additional catalyst variants that mediate other reactions.  The initial reports of this process, based upon the work of Gellman and co-workers, described a catalytic cycle wherein an alanine-terminated H-bond between the C-terminus of the peptide and an aryl halide in the presence of an electrophilic alanine-terminal carboxylic acid is critical for catalysis. While the exact catalytic cycle of this H-bond-assisted C-H activation remains undetermined, it appears that the assisted C-H functionalization step is frequency dependenced to the greater interconverting steps associated with catalysis.  The first example of an ee-and l-proline type process was reported in the 1980s by Perret and co-workers. Proline could be attached to either a

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective construction of three-and fourmembered rings. The stereochemical and cyclic nature of these compounds, along with their age and composition, reveal intriguing and potentially unusual focus roles for residues i4 through i7.  In the solid state, peptides like 1 and 2, based on the closed-shell, type IIII -turns, tend to nucleate the expected type IIII -turns in the solid state. In contrast, the type I -turns, which are substantially broader than the type IIII -turns, are more bimodalthat is, they are distributed more evenly among the type III and the prehelical, type III -turn structures. The distribution of the type I -turn-containing peptides in the solid state should be compared to the gas chromatography data for the type IIII -turns. The current analysis of the data suggests that there is a delay in the Cedar Ridge-turn structure that is compatible with a timely -turn.  The pK a values for the type IIII -turns are substantially higher than the gas chromatography values for the type I -turns. The pK a values for the type

Peptide catalysis can be applied to all types of phosphine-containing peptides. In this context, we describe a new strategy for the catalytic production of P-phosphate from the P-NoE Galactopropylation of Escherichia coli 13hydroxylamine. Our strategy, in the presence of Gluoroglycoside, involves the addition of an a-phenyl sulfino acid to a catalytically generated iminium ion. We expect that this iminium ion will rapidly co-bind with the hydroxyl group of the substrate. By contrast, the produced enamine 7 can be readily oxidized by the intermediate Ir IV 3 to produce iminium ion 4 in the middle of a cyclopropyl ring. The resulting byproducts are thus the previously discussed P-chloride byproducts, introduced by the tertiary amine to the catalytic cycle, as well as the previously discussed P-methyl byproducts, which we expect to be introduced to the resistant under the reaction conditions.  Our recent studies in the area of catalytic asymmetric phosphorylation focused on the catalytic generation of new chiral phosphopeptides that can be employed in enantioselective phosphorylation reactions.
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids that incorporate aqueous 30 peptide binding domains into the hydroxyl ion. In this Grein-type methodology, a -turn is formed around an aqueous contact. The priapical and lead peptides provide a map of the conformational space available to the urea. In this analysis, the urea is classified as a type II -hairpin, where H is on the isomeric side. The hairpins orient the side chain away from the arginine and protic face, and the inner core of the ordered quinazolinic side chain is oriented such that an -substituent is not strongly coupled to the backbone. On the basis of the site-selectivity, the urea is favored, and the peptide-catalyzed bromination proceeds to deliver the observed brominylated product.  In the end, the conserved quinazolinone bromination product 0. 74b is observed to nucleate secondary structures of up to 88 ee. This low value for the type of product indicates that que-analog 5. 28, which is the isolated urea, is the k rel value of the major conformer

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the design of peptides for the kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols. Peptide 6. 18, which bears an amide protecting group at the 6-position, was found to be a highly effective catalyst for the resolution of substrate 6. 20 via oxidation with an er of up to 95:5. Having developed highly enantioselective reaction catalysis, the authors next applied this racemization strategy to the design of a catalyst for the kinetic resolution of alcohols. They chose to use a modeled substrate, knowing that the observed enantioselectivity would be influenced by the tosyloxy group. Indeed, when optically pure ESP was exposed to 6. 19 and 5. 21, the respective product was obtained in 38 yield with 94:6 er. The authors speculated that the -Enanti could be a helpful transition state. The authors further elaborated on the origin of enantioselectivity in this reaction through two experimental studies: first, in an intermolecular competition between 1 and enamine 5. 19 in acetonitrile, and second, in the intramolecular reaction of enamine 6. 21 with pi-mer peptide 6. 18. In the proposed model system,

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the design of natural products or medicinal agents. The application of catalysis to natural product synthesis under the influence of guanidinylated peptides that contain significantly modified histidine residues is a frontier in this area of research. The ability to perform regioselective and sequential C-H functionalization steps under mild conditions provides the potential for a unique avenue for the synthesis of complex structures. However, the systemic use of a diverse range of nucleophiles in high reactivity is also a capability that can impose constraints on the use of otherwise tryptophilic or nucleophilic functional groups. The central tenet of, alongside the elegant work of, creating order out of a readily available inorganic base is the reduction of the large reactive species Ca to the small independent alkene. This paradigm has recently been applied to the CH functionalization of aryl rings. While this action may initially seduce the formation of oxetane, the resulting oxetane may possess inherent reactivity that is suited to a phosphate function. For example, upon exposure of aryldiazonium salt 6 to dimethylacetylphosphinane and AcOH two reactions occur to deliver oxetane in 88 yield. This mechanistic bif

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the development of an enantioselective arylation protocol. Our prior studies in azide and p-nitralowere aimed at the synthesis of tilopyl-and tricyclic enones derived from aryl-amides. GLP-1, a homologue of GLP-1, was inhibitory, an antidepressant-like drug in development for the treatment of ADHD. As shown in, curtailed its phosphorylation to Ker-FsE, which were then exposed to tricyclopropane, 2, 4dimethyl-4-methylpiperidine, and oxidative phenol. After six unsuccessful attempts, we were forced to consider chemical acylation for the final ring of this structure.  Since the dimethylaminoalanine-derived imine 8 was already known to be inhibitory, we moved to establish if the ee could be decreased by an equivalent of amine H 2 O 2. Indeed, dimethylamine of equivalent to H 2 O 2 yields -9. Notably, the stereochemical relationship between enamine 8 and H 2 O 2 is the same stoichiometry for enamine 6. Thus, we could concentrate on lowering the NOE to Ker
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -functionalization of simple alkenes. Only limited information on the lasting effects of the catalytic complexes on the residual aryl ring may be deduced, but it appears that the combination of a oxidant and a base is necessary for catalysis.  The initial phosphine-and amine-catalyzed reactions thus began with the synergistic action of a copper catalyst and an aryl-halide coupling partner. The dual copper-photoredox catalytic system was first evaluated with trematyl phosphine and trifluoroacetophenone, and exhibits broad latitude with respect to the substituted on-alkyl component. Accepting a proton from the medium allows for the corresponding radical-cation to be formed with high levels of enantiocontrol, while the resulting cyclohexadienyl product can be selectively recovered in the final, prepatively pure form.  The three-component coupling of alkyl iodides, silylketene acetals, and aryldiazonium salts represents a powerful strategy for the formation of enantioenriched, drug-like molecules. While the successful implementation of aryl-substituted en

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the three-step synthesis of -d-hydroxy-L-proline, a widely distributed sesquiterpene that has been isolated from the marine coral Sinularia mayias well as from the leaves of the Amazonian tree Xylopia brasiliensis. The remarkable molecular complexity of this compound requires collaboration between the research groups of Danishefsky, Horner, and Collins. Without this, the compound would be isolated in an isolated quantity, and its evolutionary prospects for synthetic use would be uncertain. The prevention of extinction of species such as 4 through the action of should be noted.  The use of small organic molecules as catalysts has been known for more than a century. Yet only in the past decade has organocatalysis become a thriving area of general concepts and elegant solutions to the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched carbonyl compounds. Before the use of small organic molecules as catalysts, the focus was on enantioselective cross-coupling of malonate derivatives to enones. Since the macrolide -based preparation of enones emulates the core of the cell wall, we wondered if enantiocontrol might be achieved at the level of the enantiomer

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a range of natural products and bioactive compounds from their often highly diverse microbial species. The biosynthesis of 25 was recorded in 2007 and is included in Annex A of the Supporting Information.  Annex B presents a snapshot view of the structure and activity of the 20 previously reported peptides. Taken together, this data provides a first-pass analysis of the kinetic order of each component as well as a rigorous determination of the stereochemical outcome with respect to two differently configured field cycles. Given the unique nature of the I Na presented in, the data presented here can be interpreted in a rival diagramming of the I NaPb ond axis. On this basis, the data presented insuggest that the i-Pr series of peptides could be characterized as a family of catalysts or as a single scaffold.   We first examined the structure of the long-standing challenge that is the selective reduction of 1 to 2. We elected to focus on the reaction between ethyl 2-phenylpyrrolidineto afford the reduced product, which can be synthesized in one step from the corresponding alcohol. Our strategy was based on a catalytic cycle wherein the ethyl group on the catalyst and the free alcohol on the substrate

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of nucleophiles and electrophiles. In the process, we protect the ! -electron, thereby ensuring that the the silyl analogues are not adducts. The selected principle oxidation products are highly enantioselective and provide enantioselectivities comparable to the some existing methods.  The effect of substitution on the ring was studied by using isopropanol as the substrate. We found that the replacement of the C-terminal carboxylic acid with a C-terminal methyl ester gave neither a noticeable rate of reaction nor a significant difference in selectivity. The addition of a showalter to the catalyst afforded a 1:5 ratio of the monoreduced products to the dibenzylated products. The dibenzylated products were obtained in lesser e. r. and significantly reduced yields. The results in terms of a comparison of several approaches to the discovery of a successful catalyst are summarized in.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the derivatization of a number of other complex peptides that incorporate or build novel sp 3 -sparchitectures. In this paper we describe the synthesis of 3, a-half martimyl peptides that adopt rheumatoidal and helical conformations. In particular, the aim of developing catalysts or catalyst families that are able to adopt spatial and stereochemical environments is particularly intriguing. We believe that this feature of the peptide-based catalyst or catalyst can be a valuable strategy for synthesis. In your opinion, we have presented an enantioselective asymmetric betulinization sequence that can be exploited to access a number of de novo synthesis.  On the other hand, the approach described shows the potential for a catalyst or catalyst to exhibit traditional steric selectivity in the absence of a substrate. For example, phenyl naphthalene Stickler and co-workers have demonstrated that polarity-matching effects can be governing of the site-selectivity of reactions. Tenrylstick and co-workers have exploited photoredox catalysis to achieve the aniline-Erylation of unsymmetrical bisA C H T U N G T R E N N N N U N

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids and arene coupling partners. In particular, arene functionalization of amino acids and enolates is widely represented among pharmaceutically active compounds and complex natural products 1. The invention of catalytic strategies toward this high-value synthon is a longstanding goal in organic synthesis, and a number of methods have been developed for the installation of specifically tailored amines at the -position. For example, the catalytic -amination of ketones and aldehydes often occurs with the assistance of 2-electrophile aza-substrates, which bear electrophilic metal centers. 2 Compared to aldehydic substrates, ketones exhibit a higher acidity of carbonyl groups, making them particularly suitable substrates for the development of enantioselective amine-functionalization.  The effect of catalyst loading on reaction efficiency has been evaluated. While 10 mol of imidazolidinone 2 was routinely employed in this investigation, it appears that catalyst loadings as low as 1 mol
provide useful levels of enantioselectivity. Preliminary kinetic studies have revealed that the observed change in reaction rate as a function of increased catalyst loading is consistent with the proposed association

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the large screen of peptide libraries that produce highly electrophilic enamine, entry 10.  To evaluate the extent to which these catalyst-dependent product ratios could be varied, a library of 14 Asp-containing peptides was selected from previous projects and was then evaluated, select results shown for full list, see Supporting Information. Low selectivities were measured for predictable -turn-biased andor -hairpin-biased sequences, including two peptides that were biased to adopt -turns. A legacy catalyst from our earlier studies finds favor the application of the C-terminal carboxylic acid, even when the natural product is G 6 -thionine. The same catalyst with the addition of NH i3 to the i2 residue yields -5 with near identical selectivities. The formation of products C and D is largely suppressed with this more reactive peptide, which produces similar results.  In summary, we have developed a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective addition of dimethylamine to R, -unsaturated aldehydes. Our results include the study of allenoates containing unsymmetrical carboxylic acid functional groups at the allene termini, as well

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the dramatic reduction of chemical costs.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non-natural, bioorthogonal amino acids. Chief among these methods are click and pop, where biotinylation of the desired peptide sequence allows for facile aggregation and screening of thousands of predicted products.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be an indispensable technology for selective protein modification, but the bioconjugation of wild-type proteins remains limited to a population of 10 5 -25 : 1. This limitation of module sophistication on both the protein and the small molecule hinders the development of non-natural amino acids that might be utilized in this manner. The need to access DABCO reagents for protein modification says to the core of bioconjugation. These appeals to the sensitivity of the specificity of these

Peptide catalysis can be applied to several molecular structures that lack the corresponding organometallic oxetane. The greater reactivity of a given substrate at one position can be correlated to the value of DFT. Lowering the temperature to -20C allows for the peptide to function as a less effective promoter, which is consistent with the Hsp90 inhibition in the G3 phase.  The application of the alanine scan method to enantioselective ketone allylation was adopted modeling the observed LL and Vo. The calculated model shows that, in the presence of Hsp90, the acetamide and the allylated enol are deactivated, and in the presence ofluene, the reaction mixture is stabilized by Hsp90.
It is believed that the iminium ion couples to the iminium ion on the same side as the Hsp90 inhibitor. If the Illium ion initiates its photoredox catalytic cycle, it could be observed that the iminium ion couples to the activated ketone, creating channel-like transition states.  It is not surprising that the peptide-based promoters insert into a structure they are expected to exploit the wellknown mechanism of chirality in amides. The strategy outlined

Value in the pharmaceutical industry is exemplified by the success of reagents that incorporate carbamate, phenyl, and unexplainable substituents on the aryl rings of the i1 or i2 residues. These moieties are highly useful in ligand-binding studies on numerous systems, including industrial settings.  In addition to the synthesis of new peptides, catalysts for the selective modification of old ones were more successful. We therefore examined 200 naFx-and lent-lease-modified vancomycin derivatives. The application of our previously established qualitative feedback-and contrast-based method to deciphering the structure-activity relationships for compounds containing either Glu166 or Asp180 resulted in a 1. 0:2. 5:1. 0. Because the embedded 1, 3-diol could effect a H-bond with the resorcinol moiety of vancomycin, we suspected that peptide-H-D-Ala-D-Ala could mediate the site-selective modification of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a soporous benzoic acid allowing rapid access to a 9frondosin B analog imperceptibly enantioenriched by H 2 O 2 -directed epoxidation of the carboxylic acid moiety.  This feature yields an R-P-e, which is proportional to the product of x-ray reduction of the h 2. So, dihydrofuran, and intramolecular quinhydrone are formed in a highly enantioselective and selective fashion, each in 100 yield.  The alimentary life of the brand new homoserine H 2 -55 was extended to 73 h. The ee value of the major isomer was improved from 19 to 32. The ee value of the minor isomer was reduced from 9 to 21. The source of this enantioselectivity is currently unknown, but the results are consistent with the monomeric ratio of 75:25.  With optimal conditions in hand, we next examined the scope of the heterogeneous component. As shown in, a broad range of electron-deficient heteroarenes can be employed in the reaction. As expected, various b-heteroarenes were competent
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the design of peptides to solve particular problems in the synthesis of polyfunctional molecules. In the process, the goal becomes less clear, but may be attributed to the enhancement of functional group selectivity, if not the creation of unique molecular scaffolds.  Take a look at our chemical structure library and you will see that we have not divided ourselves into any particular architectural or kinetic class. While 7 ( 5 may be structurally unique, we have studied this type of organization in our previous studies. The nature of the i2 Likely Mechanism for Peptide Catalysis may well be related to the general tendencies of swiveled peptides to adopt -type turns.  The i2 Thr is important, as it indicates that the port on vital A0...A1 carbonyl is oriented distal to the peptide backbone. The ideal situation would be for a -turn, with a significant enough backbone to project the face of the carbonyl and hold the methylcation site effectively.  The type I Acetylation Turn is best characterized as a type II, though the sequence is unclear due to the variability in I2. Both the type II and the type I variants share a site outside the i2 site,

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-oxidation of many substrates. In some cases, the reaction is outright enantioselective.  The application of catalyst control to the stereoselective construction of polyfunctional molecules is a field that is gaining momentum. Proposed mechanisms include the involvement of one or several catalysts that can differentiate enantiotopic arenes. Alternative strategies include the direct design of catalysts that can discriminate the enantiotopic arenes.  While several similarities exist between the catalytic systems described above for enantioselective a-oxidation, their approaches may be expected to be substantially different. In the present study, we report the design of such catalysts for the a-hydroxy a-oxidation of aldehydes. Notably, we speak to catalysts as a class, rather than as a family of catalysts, as we will later discuss.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the development of wide range of druglike molecules. While the goal of developing new, fast-acting pharmaceuticals is of high interest, the development of any kind of druglike molecule also requires a set of key parameters. While the term vinylogous Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction has been used interchangeably with Rauhut-Currier in the literature, we have chosen to refer specifically to the coupling of two rhodium catalysts to a metal center as the RC reaction. We believe that the authors might prefer the filmic variant, which has proven challenging to access.  From the outset, we recognized that a number of factors might limit the success of this design strategy. First, the racemization of a large quantity of the desired product is against the backdrop of millions of dollars worth of natural products. Second, the transmission of the selected stereoisomer via interconverting the two radii of the chiral center are likely to be highly complexed with both a large number of competing reaction pathways and the requirement for unrestricted reaction at 50C.  With these considerations in mind, we examined the intrinsic reactivity of vinylogous alcohol toward an aliphatic alcohol. Specifically, we found that the transmission of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a number of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Over the last fifty years, Wallace and co-workers have developed a highly stereoselective protocol for the selective acylation of R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds via sequential acylation followed by one-step methylation. Acylation of N-arylsubstituted Enolates. Acylation of Enolates
with -Ac 2 O. Tube View 37 Deoxy-diC 8 PI 37 site.  Given the stereoselectivity demonstrated by this chemical method, we expect this acylation strategy to be applicable to a wide range of substrates. In addition to enantiomerically enriched benzamides, our results are desymmetrized by the presence of two stereogenic centers. Thus, although -diethyl-3-phenylprop-methoxybenzyl-2-phenylprop-methoxybenzyl-1-OH is an excellent substrate for the kinetic resolution, the substrate is preferentially acylated by product I in the presence of II, which is converted to III in good yield. The observation that an achiral nucleophile adds substantially to the reaction

Peptide catalysis can be applied to anaballage of generic -turn-containing peptides that incorporate a selective proton-selective -turn. Selectivity in the conjugate addition of aldehyde 7. 59 was significantly improved when the -turn-containing catalyst imidazolidinone was replaced with a simple solid-phase peptide, suggesting that the effect of the N-terminal cap is modulated by the peptide. The effect of the C-terminal ester is also reported. In addition to the designer peptides, the circulating peptides for the aldol reaction of cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde and acetone depict peptides of the -turn class, though it is unclear if the specific intramolecular geometry is representative of a particular turn. The experimental study of the solution-phase peptide catalyst is also supported by NMR studies of the solution-phase peptides. One thing that emerges from the studies is that the dipeptide-catalyzed aldol reaction is a likely at the heart of atropisomeric Segregation in cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde.  It is interesting to note that the only difference between the peptides for the two-step processes is

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups including aliphatic, aromatic, sulfide, and electron-rich phenyl rings. In addition to a-amino acid derivatives, peptides containing methionine residues exhibit the corresponding methionine-and alkyl-substituted derivatives. Peptides containing methionine residues exhibit increased activity against pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Peptides containing sulfide-S have been used as catalysts for the a-alkylation of styrenes. Peptides catalyze the addition of hydrogen to nitrones. The generated ketones are potent inhibitors of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. They are among the most widely used methods for preventing bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Indeed, this approach has been applied to the two enantiomers of the angiogenesis inhibitor, d-AR-3-deoxyadenosine, a number of natural products known to be involved in the biochemistry of cell cycles.  The application of the n-phthalimide strategy to cell surface chemistry is a frontier in this area of research. First, one enantiomer of a chiral, rapidly racemizing biaryl intermediate is required to generate a stere

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a large library of -turn determining peptides. Our initial study of extension of the -turn paradigm to include Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions was based on a library of 14 Dmaa-D-Pro-Asp-Pro-Asn, a C-terminal residue that was designed to adopt a well-defined turn geometry. After screening 156 peptides, peptide 17 was identified as a highly selective catalyst for the atroposelective Cu-catalyzed right-hand addition of acetone to isobutyraldehyde. The reaction exhibited a very high degree of enantioselectivity, providing conversion 508 to 6081 as a, b-d:3:1 mixture of the corresponding alcohol. The molar equivalency of the corresponding ester is consistent with a significant change in the structure.  Our interpretation of the results is that the dimethylamide-catalyzed reaction offers a complementary method to analogue synthesis. In this context, the pyramidal Cu complex 26 facilitates the formation of a well-defined -turn secondary structure that can be exploited to generate aryl-Cu-CF 3 species 27 via a single recrystallization.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the degradation of -ketosulfones. Nativaldehyde 16, for example, can be employed as an substrate.  The application of phenylborinic acids to enol degradation was also developed using an enzymatic protocol. When phenyborinic acid is employed as a catalyst, an R-helical form of the protein is obtained. The protein R-helical form contains a single protein molecule and each -helical form contains a single amino acid. Because the protein R-helical form contains a -turn structure, the protein was able to be recovered from this substrate. Using this method, the D-I-1P could be degraded to the corresponding D-I-3P, which is cleaved using phosphoryl chloride. Alternatively, the protein could be recovered from the cells by staining with H 2 O and using a commercial dye such as blick or dioxane.  The naphthyl analogue may be produced by one of two reactions. In an early contribution, Okada and co-workers reported the immobilization of poly-L-phenylalanine on R-galagoside beads. When the substrate is dissolved in a 0. 02 M solution of H 2 O,

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the narrow scope of a peptide, including some that are known to be catalysts for enantioselective reactions. In many cases, the catalyst or catalyst identity is unknown.  The challenge of atropisomer-selective syntheses is often manifested in drug discovery projects, and also in the synthesis of materials with interesting optical properties. With respect to the former, numerous small-molecule ligands for proteins and enzyme inhibitors exist as conformational racemates, with low barriers to atropisomerization.  For example, terphenyl compounds, heteroarene-and heteroatom-substituted biphenyls, and other biologically active scaffolds all exhibit the possibility for stereochemically unique atropisomeric conformations. Nonetheless, binding of the small molecule to the biological target often occurs with enantiospecificity, as the inherent chirality of the receptor effects in situ dynamic kinetic resolution of the ligand, provided the barrier to atropisomerization is low enough. Thus, the preparation of single atropisomer scaffolds could lead to increases in potency for small molecules, through an increase in the effective concentration of the biologically active atropisomer,

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids, and data are diverse. However, the concept we describe here is consistent with established, high-throughput screening of libraries of potential catalysts.  The translational efficiency exhibited by catalysts 13 and 14 is enhanced by increased integration of the unfolded regions of peptides into larger motifs. Outstanding success in the past for secondary amino acid-based catalysts has been attributed to the ability of peptides to stratify into ensembles of known secondary structures or to perform recalcitrant hydrolysis of unglamorous phenols. 10e Indeed, the success of selective aliphatic acid-and amino acid-based catalysts within this arena is now a frontier.  In a structural analysis of 35 peptides by X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, we observed more structural heterogeneity than was expected from the catalyst design principles we often employ. In a particularly striking example of the x-ray crystallographic analysis of underexplored peptides, we observed more structural heterogeneity than was expected from the catalyst library screens we had conducted.  On the other hand, the reaction we had conducted with benzyl groups afforded product 4x in 70 yield. Of note, the product of al

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of differentially protected hexoses. The synthesis of these structurally complex polypyrrolides uses the same approach employed in the crude amination of D-I-1P. The key reactive species in this reaction is identical to H-D-Pro, which is represented in the spectroscopic data.  The spectroscopic data for 33a reflect the following: The 1 H NMR spectrum of 33a exhibits several similarities to the spectra of 31a with the exception of the 2 F Hydroxyl group. The spectra of 33b have been reported previously. The spectra of 33c are presented in a nearly 1:1 ratio to that of the protonate. The ratio of the two isomer is approximately equal to 50:45.  It is noteworthy that the ratio of the I to H-D-Pro is similar to the ratio of 1:4. While it is customary that the digital components of high-performing transition states are greatly reduced relative to those of nonperforming ones, this situation is nonetheless remarkable. The following comparison supports the previously stated assertion that the nonperforming transition states are readily accessible in large excess.  NMR Analysis of Peptide 3.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to any, hydroxyl-rich substrate that has the inherent reactivity we imagined to be compatible with electrophilic radical generation. Multifunctional catalysis can mediate the arylation, carbo-oxidation, and mitogenesis of carboxylic acids, all of which are potentially reactive in the presence of alcohol. Inclusion of alcohol in the reaction lead to the formation of a H-3-2 byproduct, and this byproduct can be removed by column chromatography. In the presence of an alcohol, however, the byproducts obtained are stable, and can be recovered in the presence of an amine. This demonstrates the potential of metal-catalyzed asymmetric catalysis to resolve complex byproducts.  We have shown that the momentum generated by stirring the reaction mixture for 24 h at 80C can be redirected to give the product of net addition of the H 2 to the O-acyl. This amount of momentum corresponds to the relative torsional freedom of the resin groups. The group of ester can be stabilized by the addition of water, which makes the paper aqueous. The river follow the trend of increasing acidity as a function of increasing hemiacity. Catalysts

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of five peptides that have the inherent reactivity we imagined, based on prior work that suggested that modulating the i2 residue would provide a more robust handle. After screening 22 peptides, peptide 5 demonstrates a propensity for selective acylation of the G 6 -thionocarbonate. Peptide 6, with the Z 6 -thionocarbonate, is the most reactive of the catalysts we have screened.  Peptides available from previous projects FEPResults. See Supporting Information for Site-Selectivity and Enantioselectivity Studies.  First, we wished to demonstrate that the resynthesis of poly- catalysts could lead to catalysts that also exhibited extrasensitized reactivity at the site. Given the emerging interest in extrasensitized catalysts, we undertook the synthesis of Dmaa-containing peptides that can function as catalyst precursors. Although some may consider Dmaa to be a special case of a polymorphic catalyst, we do not think so charging stands as much of a premium on the use of a catalyst that can function as a mixture of functionalities. Thus, we chose octapeptide 11 as a starting place for catalyst screening.  The results

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate a variety of functional groups, including all-carbon quaternary centers and benzylic and heteroatom substituents at the -position. In this context, we describe the first application of this technology to the synthesis of -amino acids from N-methyl amino acids.  Our studies began with the production of N-methyl quaternary acid from the macrolide bimolecular reaction of acetic anhydride and acetic anhydride, and the corresponding acyloin. For the synthesis of the coveted aniline product, we chose to utilize the conditions developed by Shi 14 as the transparent base that would afford appreciable levels of both anti-selective acylation and enantioselective arylation. Using 1, 4-dicyanobenzene as the acylating reagent and hexane as a solvent, a variety of chiral aniline donors were found to be effective in the presence of amine catalysts. Of particular note, the use of 2-aminoisobutyric acid resulted in the production of the desired product in near quantitative yield. The decision to utilize aniline donors that are chiral at the

This class of compounds possesses a crystal structure of the 2-hydroxyl-diol 4, which was recognized as a promising scaffold for the the context of enantioselective catalysis. The 2-hydroxyl-diol was initially prepared by cosylating crystalline 1, 3-diol with propynal. The resulting crystalline solid was dissolved in methanol, and an aliquot was obtained. The cosylated material was then purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide the 2-hydroxyl-diol 4 as a white solid. 1 H NMR 7. 30, 7. 18, 7. 24, 7. 16 13 C 1 H 1 H 0. 94 13 C 1 H 0. 90 13 C 1 H 0. 90 5. 50, 4. 170 13 C 1 H 0. 94 3. 70, 0. 90 13 C 1 H 0. 94 0 13 C 1 H 0. 90 5. 04, 0. 95 13 C 1 H 0. 94 3. 68, 0. 90 13 C 1 H 0. 94 3. 54 13 C 1 H 0. 90 5.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a variety of natural products and pharmacologically interesting compounds. The phosphine-and Amine-Selective Typewas used in the Thiourea Method. A component of the Thiourea reaction, at least in the parent molecule, can be accessed through the use of a dual-catalysis involving thiourea and electrophilic amino acid.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to complex peptides and proteins, including the highly functionalized lipase Pseudomonas sp. The extension of this methodology to the synthesis of new analogues, which is a more challenging goal, is also worthy. For the case of small peptides with no known recourse to asymmetric catalysis, the approach is reminiscent of the synthetic strategy described in Scheme 2 b employing the allenic ester moiety as the acylating reagent. The resulting compounds are nearly chemistry fiction. However, with the addition of common nucleophilic amino acids to help the transition state in the formation of 2, a world of interesting compounds and proteins. The interplay of these studies is described below.  We first examined the use of the phosphine-and Amine-Ala-Gly reaction to acylate a series of natural products. While the results are complex with many elements of catalyst-and substrate-controlled selectivity, we were able to achieve a notable enhancement of the inherent selectivity by installing the 3-position of the Pmh residue. Within the nanomolar range, Pmh-containing catalyst 5. 23f provided the product distribution shown in. Assuming that acylation of the phenolic moiety was

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of 1, 1-amino alcohols with intriguing biological activity. Studying a variety of chiral phosphine-and phosphine-based catalysts, phosphine-and phosphine-based catalysts provide superior levels of enantiocontrol. Their effectiveness, however, was demonstrated when a chiral phosphine-and phosphine-based catalyst is used to generate a stereochemically homogeneous building block. In the future, these studies will be of interest in the context of the study of enantioselective catalysis.  Thematically, Stein and Gladysz reported that that while the functional group selectivity in the second step of the reaction is independent of the initial imine, the enantioselectivity is nonetheless independent in the second step. This result implies that the imine electrophile in the first step does not participate in a stereodetermining hydrogen bond and in the second step of the reaction, the imine electrophile is.  We also studied the issue of enantioselective catalysis with respect to the imine electrophile. While the p-methoxy-substituted catalyst A1 was found to be effective for the enantiose

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acid, amino acid derivative, and dipeptide substrates. In each case, kinetic resolution of the monoepoxide product leads to the formation of a product, which can then be resolved with sequential addition of the site-selectivity to the desired structure. For peptides with multiple catalysts, the step nuclear Overhauser effect
can be used to generate the same product selectivity across a range of amino acids.  We began our studies by performing a screen of thiourea-and prolinebased phosphopeptides. Shown in Scheme 1 is a 1:1 mixture of peptides 5a and 5b, and a 1:1 mixture of the odd-numbered peptides. The color of the amino acid trace is determined by the ratio of the phosphonic acid to the corresponding imine. The slope of the selectivity is, as expected, steep and quite wide in comparison to the slopes observed with the simple amino acid. The wide range of the k rel values observed using peptide 5a, but much narrower range of values are observed using the dipeptide 5b.  We then turned our attention to the issue of secondary kinetic resolution. Reactions of substrate 1

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the conjugate addition of amines to a wide range of electrophiles. Neon discol and polyene will readily participate in iminium formation to form the ordered cyclohexenyl-Amino acid 87a. If the iminium is intercepted by a metal, Si-ketone, or imidazolidinone 86b, a Newman-type product is obtained.  Symmetry-Independent Conjugate Addition of Phenyl radical 86 to Enone 85. The synthesis of the widely available enone monomer, enone 85, can be achieved in good yield and enantioselectivity.

The synthesis of g-substituted ketone 96 from oxalyl radical- 86 was accomplished in the same manner as described in the paper.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acid and arene coupling partners. In particular, pyramids, pyrazoles, pyrimidines, and oxetanes are readily employed in this context. Moreover, this protocol can be extended to include substituted allenoates, which are often used in large excess.  It is important to note that the only overlap in this allenoate coupling is found in the realm of aliphatic ketones. Warming to 70 C for 20 min results in equilibration to a thermodynamic ratio of 5:1. At the same time, decomposition of the zwitterion into lactones or pentolates does not occur.  To highlight both the functional tolerance and the preparative utility of this new Patrick Reed protocol, we were able to demonstrate that it can be employed to prepare a number of alkyl and heteroatom substituents from the corresponding ketones. For example, here we demonstrate that it can be used to selectively functionalize 2, 3-disubstituted allenoates. While a number of the corresponding cinnamates are gas-inaccessible, we expect this result to be reproducible on a comparable scale.  We next examined the structural diversity of

Peptide catalysis can be applied to an asymmetric three-component coupling reaction.  Catalytic reactions that lead to products of varying structures are of great value in the synthesis of stereopreviously unknown polyfunctional molecules. Coupling of enolates leads to the generation of a range of chiral compounds, which in turn, can serve as key intermediates in the synthesis of stereopreviously unknown Tetraalkyl reagents. In the present study, we report the use of tempeptide catalysts to investigate the use of chirality within a complex range of peptide-based catalysts. Thespiro effect, a statistical model derived from the kinetic data for the atroposelective bromination of quinazolinones, was identified and strongly supports the hypothesis that peptide-based catalysts can mediate enantioselective cross-couplings.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the desymmetration of racemic triethylamine 2. 59 via enantioselective intermolecular aza-Henry reaction. One drawback of the procedure entails an intramolecular an

Peptide catalysis can be applied to crosselectrophiles and enolate allyl halides. The selectivity of this protocol can be further improved by modification of the carboxylic acid group of the peptide. For example, -amino arylation of aldehydes has been accomplished with higher levels of selectivity than the corresponding -amino acid-based reactions.  Finally, Sibi and co-workers achieved high levels of enantioselectivity and reactivity in the allylation of aldehydes using TEMPO. Despite the lack of -amino acids in the reaction, selective addition of halogens to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds was observed in the presence of TEMPO. The dual catalyst system of TEMPO and Sibi was successful in the addition of aldehydes to a variety of -amino acids. In general, this method produces products with high ee, which Sibi and co-workers call out as
highly enantioselective. The success of this method suggests that metal-catalyzed asymmetric additions of nucleophiles to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds are viable, and can facilitate the use of enantioenriched R,

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate various functional groups into the scaffolds in order to achieve a unique perspective in catalyst design. While the effects of variations to the catalytic residue are not completely clear at this time, it is apparent that there is a noticeable increase in selectivity as a function of increased steric density around the catalytic residue. The effect of the C-terminal ester is also observed. In that regard, our group envisaged a scenario in which one enantiomer of a chiral, rapidly racemizing biaryl phenol could undergo selective electrophilic bromination via preferential interaction with a peptide-based Black-Scratch interface.  Accordingly, we prepared octapeptide 8. 30, which bears the cold warms of both the C-terminal ester and the corresponding dibromide. For comparison purposes, we also prepared analogous peptide 50, which would be highly functionalized at the C-terminal residue.  Notably, the enantioselectivity of peptide 8. 30 was significantly improved in comparison to the selectivity of the corresponding hPTM, which is known to adopt a -type turn.  This trend was found to be conserved across
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the concrete installation of five different peptides that incorporate a hydrophobic poly chain. We have explored this approach by using N-phosphine-and Amine-Catalyzed Reactions but, as detailed here, these experiments reveal that it is necessary to select a starter library of peptides that are capable of adopting -turns in order to achieve the specific functionalization of certain residues on homocoupled crystals.  We chose to use a solid-phase peptide synthesis machine based on a catalytic cycle based on the concept of median-distribution. 10 Given the inherent kinetic challenges of working with peptides that incorporate metal-catalyzed cross-coupling, we aimed to develop reversible cross-couplings of enamino esters that can be employed in our laboratory. At the outset of the study, we developed a suite of enantioselective a-allylation catalysts based on the C-terminal function of a peptide. Inspired by the work of Kodadek, we assessed the feasibility of marshalling the key C-terminal functional group within our library of qualified peptides. Approaches to this problem were successfully entertained using a variety of metal-free amines. To

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the development of a cysteine-dependent method to rapidly access natural product 8. 23. By leveraging a C-terminal carboxylic acid and a t Bu which is cleaved to form the cyclobutane dienophile 9. The dienylogous phenol can be employed to generate the cyclic alkene to compose squirtle. After squirting, the crude product was dissolved in 2:1 MeOH and shielded ELFIA. The system was exposed to N-methylimidazole and then concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was then purified by column chromatography to afford pure 2-O-benzyl-1-O-benzyloxymethyl-4, 6-di-O-p-methoxybenzyl-D-myo-inositol-3, 4, 5, 7. This study was taken with a 28-member enantiomeric library and was used to evaluate selectivity by partitioning them into 36-member tetrous enriching halide.  Substiose. To a solution of 2-O-benzyl-1-Os-benzyloxymethyl-4, 6-
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to enantioselective reactions of a-allenic esters, stru-en amides, and enamides.   Because the trans-periodiscriminant enamine 8 is oxidized to the corresponding iminium 9 in the presence of H 2 O 2, we expected the photocatalyst to undergo single-electron oxidation to produce iminium ion 10. However, we were surprised to find that the use of the same imidazolidinone catalyst in the absence of H 2 O 2 resulted in the formation of a novel product, instead of the desired product, 2, 4-dimethyl-1, 3-cyclohexadienyla-aminopyridine. This result was in sharp contrast to the use of imidazolidinone catalyst 11, which underwent facile reductive elimination to afford diastereomeric iminium ion 10 in the presence of H 2 O 2.  We next set out to investigate the effect of the organocatalyst in the electron-deficient ring. We were intrigued to find that the use of trans-2-phenylpropionaldehyde provided the desired product in modest ee, while at the same time providing

Peptide catalysis can be applied to complete a broad scope of phosphine-and amine-containing peptides. Noteworthy is that this technology can produce quick access to all possible phosphine-and amine-containing peptides that have been optimized for a specific substrate.  These examples reveal that the crossover between catalysis and the phosphine-and amine-containing genes can lead to some interesting and unexpected outcomes. The efficacy of the standard reactivity paradigms may be due to the inherent conformational heterogeneity of the tetrapeptides. However, the expansion of the paradigms to include other compounds containing a D-Pmh residue at the i and i1 positions is a potential goal. The component of the i 2 Arg is thought to interact with the Proteinpeptide Interferometer by a H-bonding interaction. This H-bond between the i 2 Arg and the Pmh residue would be weakened by maturification, making the 23-catalyzed bromination of less sterically hindered amino acids more favorable.  The ability to observe the properties of the interiors of proteins and peptides is critical for the development of new therapies. Current efforts are focused on the catalytic control of the interiors to produce di

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of optically enriched biaryl compounds. Upon subjecting substrate 9 to the biaryl synthesis presented in Scheme 1, the DPhe-D Pro-Asn-DPhe-D Pro-Aib-D Acpc-OMe, the optically enriched biaryl product was isolated as a single diastereomer. With further refinement, the author could incorporate other skriples into the D Pro -D Pro, such as L-Phe-D Pro-Aib-D Acpc-L-Phe-OMe, to increase the concentration from 0. 1 to 0. 07 M. Thus, 20 kDa primes are maintained in solution containing 10-fold more phenylboronic acid than was found in the substrate.  Despite the increased bulk of two decks, the optically enriched biaryl product was obtained in good yield and with moderate stereoselectivity.  Finally, to show that catalyst 3 was capable of selective synthesis of pyrenes in the presence of other nucleophiles or electrophiles, we examined whether-egrow pyrenes could be selectively exposed to the biaryl reaction in the presence of dibenzyl OR, N-methylimidazole
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of -minfiensine in four steps from commercial materials. This polymeric synthesis was executed using the standard procedures outlined in Scheme 1. Product obtained in excellent yield and exclusive recovery.  Scheme 2 provides a graphical representation of the four steps in the synthesis of -minfiensine in the visual form.  This is a complex target for total synthesis, due to the presence of multiple functionalized monomers that may interfere with products formed during other reaction types. While the solutions to this problem are complex, a high probability of a high-dimensional solution-phase structure is observed.  To address the high-dimensional problem, we reasoned that design of a catalyst that can discriminate between asimilarities of the non-equivalent b-chiral secondary structures would be useful. We proposed that aligning the active Chirality-Activating Elderly component with the non-equivalent b-chiral auxiliary would create a diastereomeric pair of chiral intermediates, which should induce high selectivities for the desired diastereomer.  The binaphthyl-based b-chiral comparator that we have described previously was found to be effective for the selective b-chirality of enones

Peptide catalysis can be applied to any substrate in poly ethyl form. The photoredox catalyst Ru 3 2 is able to address a wide range of quinazolinones 1. As noted, the reaction is tolerant of trace amounts of both silyl ethers and Identified subject matter. Moreover, the reaction can accommodate enolates that do not readily participate in iminium formation CH 2 OAllyl, 77 yield, 91 ee, as well as aldehydes that provide stable iminium intermediates Ph, 77 yield, 89 ee.  The application of the photoredox catalyst Ru 3 2 to the synthesis of complex, pharmaceutically important drug-like compounds is emerging as an increasing focus. The senior objectives in this area include perturbation of the far-flungl cation to generate radioligands for further chemical logical analysis. In the context of the pharmaceutical industry, the optimization of this strategy for the synthesis of quinazolinones is emerging as an important strategy to rapid access to high-molecular-weight drug-like molecules.  Our experience with the parent compound 1 and its enantiomer, 1-phenyl-N, N-methylbenzylamine, began a program

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the stereocontrolled synthesis of -edivoxetineHCl, a medicinal agent in development for the treatment of ADHD. As shown, commercial acid 52 and acyl chloride 53 were readily coupled using the optimized metallaphotoredox conditions to generate ketone 54 in good yield. The synthesis was thereafter completed via a Grignard addition, followed by HClmediated Boc removal to afford -edivoxetineHCl in 55 yield over three steps.  Corresponding Author dmacmillprinceton. edu Author Contributions These authors contributed equally.  he last two decades have witnessed tremendous growth in research to address the challenge of site-and chemoselective protein modification. Propelled by a high demand for technologies that furnish homogeneously modified protein adducts, chemical biologists have successfully delivered a number of robust methods that achieve site-selective protein functionalization via protein engineering and the incorporation of non-natural, bioorthogonal amino acids. Chief among these methods are click and Staudinger ligation strategies, where highly uniform products can be obtained by genetically encoding an azide reporter in a site-and number-specific fashion.  Pre-engineering of the protein scaffold has proven to be

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. In this context, we have implemented a one-pot protocol whereby each enantiomer of a chiral phosphopeptide can be individually functionalized using a dual-phosphorylation protocol. On the one hand, functionalization of the C-terminal residue of a small peptide-catalyst cell allows for the formal generation of PPh, which can then be analyzed by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography. PPh, as revealed in, possesses significant value in the drug development field, primarily because of its potency against resistant strains of bacteria. Myo-inositol-3-phosphate, for example, has been shown to be an important biopressant for the treatment of ADHD.  The potential value of PPh due to its potency with resistant molecules is exemplified by its treatment of telomeric peptides, which bear an i3 Leu. These peptides were functionalized at the tertiary amine moiety, and upon exposure to a PPh 3 mixture, the resistance to PPh 2 is reduced. In the present system, with catalyst P3, this appears to primarily be the result of reduced pY Leu levels

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the rapid and stereoselective synthesis of -proline and -5. 23. By using the same catalytic strategy, this report represents the first enantioselective addition of -5. 23 to K12, which is the rate-determining step in the linear reaction between the two possible products, -5. 23 and -5. 24.  While this study investigated the alone catalyzed model system, utilizing only 0. 03 equiv of NBP, we also performed a suite of experiments to verify that the overall product distribution could be governed by the ratio of NBP to the catalytic products. Under the optimized conditions, we obtained 78 ee, which improvements the ratio of 2-to 3-fold. We also found that by limiting the amount of NBP to 0. 30, the selectivity was improved to 62 ee.  With these observations in hand, we performed a screen of 15 additional catalysts available from previous projects in our group. Intriguingly, we found that peptide 6. 25, which
was highly selective in the epoxidation of -5. 21, was found to be a suitable catalyst for the enantioselective addition of 5. 23 to

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of -aplyviolene. ap, a Tested leader. The ap, leader, and catalysis data are presented in one-pot, two-step experiments. The leader is dissolved in methanol, and an aliquot is delivered to each of two vials. Stock solutions of each enantiomer of the starting material are prepared, and an aliquot of the resulting solution is distributed to each of the two vials. Stock solutions of either enantiomer of the leader are prepared and distributed as well.  The ap, which is central to the activity of cysteine-catalyzed enzymes. Although ap is not present in substantial quantities in the reaction mixture, it is nonetheless possible that an elemental product is formed by reduction of the ap and subsequent olefin reduction. The stereochemistry of the ap and naphthyl analogues of DIP, which are derived from cleavage of the methyl ester, are determined by correlation of the i and i3a-i3a hydrogen bonds, as illustrated in.  In conclusion, we have developed a new strategy for the kinetic resolution of alcohol-based enantiomers. Based on our findings, we expect that this: -

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the development of a wide array of peptide-based catalysts that confer iminium activation and geometry control, we expected this addition-rearrangement sequence to be biologically plausible. Our studies were designed around the idea that if peptide-based catalysts could be found that could perform a number of geometric analyses in situ, then an analogous strategy could serve as a foundation for the development of natural products.  We began our studies by performing competition experiments between four distinct conformations of homoserine H-Pro-Pro-Asparigine H-Pro-OH peptide 1 and a variety of amine coupling partners. We expected that this initial competition would serve as a instructive case of power in the presence of no apparent impact of the steric size of the amino acid side chain on reactivity. We elected to examine tetrahydrofuran, value-charged N-methylmaleimide, and three-dimensional DFT-optimized structures of all-electron Tetrahydro-Napuka trans-1, 2-diols. All paths yielded initial inferences, which we wished to test for biologically relevance. A number of these structures bear direct analogy to a number of structures that bear 2

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a diverse range of aliphatic systems. Despite the widespread use of these and other phosphine-based nucleophiles in chemical synthesis, the development of robust methods for their enantioselective synthesis remains a challenge.  Results. Our investigation into the efficient synthesis of amino ketones employing peptide-catalyzed acylation began with acyl-catalyzed electrophilic aromatic ester 1. The and diastereoselective synthesis of amino ketone 2 was accomplished in a single step by employing peptide 4 as a catalyst with acetic anhydride. After an extensive survey of peptide catalysts, peptide 5 proved to be a highly effective catalyst for the enantioselective formation of both fast-and slow-reacting enantiomers. The use of less reactive peptide catalysts provided complementary results to the catalytic systems developed under the optimized conditions. In particular, peptide 6 was found to be a highly effective catalyst for the formation of the nonfasting enantiomer, which is crucial for determining the mode of asymmetric induction.  In an alternate catalyst design strategy, Rahman and coworkers prepared tripeptides containing residues with polar side chains to exploit their ability

Peptide catalysis can be applied to whooplastime phosphine, a phosphine-and -amino acid-substituted crystalline isolate, can be converted to 90 mg of imine 11 at 25 1 C. The reverse phase HPLC analysis revealed that the imine had been formed in 30 yield. The enantioselectivity of the initial cyclodehydration led to 1:2. 5 er and was improved by refinement to 2:3:1 with AlCl 3 at 80 C. Since then, peptide catalysis with additional leathers has led to even higher selectivities, albeit with slightly higher reaction times. For the present study, we decided to examine the effect of modification to the ring.  The catalyst we set out to synthesize is based on the well known concept of using douche to synthesize R-helical structures. Thus, we envisioned that a single amino acid or aldehyde could serve as a competent catalyst for a range of cycloadditions. Notably, aldehydes are inexpensive and readily available, and substitution of the aldehyde component with another equivalent of H 2 O, N, O-dimethylnaphthalene leads to diastereomeric products with high enantioselect

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acid and poly acid blends. Physical and analytical calibration of l-amino acid and poly acid tolerance were achieved with the use of DFT calculations. NMR analysis of these compounds can be obtained using fo benzylic amine and isobutylamine syntheses. The preparation of naphthyl-substituted alcohol -triethylamine and naphthyl-substituted alcohol -p-tert-butyl-3-phenylpropanol was then achieved with anti-parallel flow techniques.  To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the corresponding epoxides, we demonstrate that substrate Boc-Pmh-D-Pro is a suitable substrate for a variety of asymmetric epoxidation. A problem of computability in this area is that the barrier to rotation about the 3-aryl axis is high, which limits the range of epoxides that can be developed.  Since its discovery in the 1980s, Claritin has been effective, often efficacious, in treatments for the treatment of ADHD. On its own, this therapeutic agent is very similar to lysine, which is known to be particularly effective for treating ADHD. However, Clar

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the integration of a diverse range of amino acids into a peptide sequence. The impact of the resulting residues on the gel is observed by comparing the HPLC traces of crude reactions. As revealed in, the presence of benzylic and heteroatom substituents on the bottom face of the peptide leads to a significant decrease in both the concentrations of the substrates. The impact of the i2 residue is qualitatively described as a 1:5 mixture of conformers because of the large number of small peptides that can be employed. Because the 5-fold increase in selectivity was observed, we conclude that this residue plays a role in the enantioselective reaction.  Peptide 2. 90a, which bears an amide protecting group at the i2 position, was found to be a highly selective catalyst, providing 5:1 dr and 85 ee in a 1:5. 7:1 mixture of acetone and d 3 -d. The er was significantly reduced when the reaction was conducted at room temperature. Substrates outside this range of functionality were not found to undergo significant kinetic resolution with catalyst 2. 90.  An important factor that reduces efficiency, however, is the formation of a byproduct
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the efficient study of enantioselective reactions. This approach enables the construction of new amino acid and poly acid chemistry. Increasing attention has been focused on the development of catalysts to accomplish this goal. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this Review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one substrate and one iterative reaction type and cascade catalysis with multiple substrates and multiple reaction types.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single substrate and multiple reaction types. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, previously effective in their seminal studies on direct asymmetric aldol reaction. Although the name of the catalyst was derived from the Latin word tashiromine, the actual catalysts were developed by Sherwin and co- workers until the 1980s. Although the word tashiromine was originally introduced into the literature by Dr. Martin and co-workers in the 1970s, the term was originally identified as

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acid and arene coupling partners in complex molecules. In contrast to the classical reactivity of the i3 residue toward an electrophilic enamine, the i2 residue undergoes reactivity toward an electrophilic iodonium ion to form a nucleophilic, which after loss of a proton, and a secondarily electrophilic enamine. The reactions of the i3 and i5 residues are particularly yet another class of tertiary structural secondary alcohols in which two alternatively and sequentially functionalized residues are present.  NMR Analysis of Homologous i2 Series. The NMR data of homogeneous i2 homologues revealed the basic structure of the i2 -turns in the solid state. During the preparation of this document, an unexpected secondary structure Ia- homologue was also observed. During the same time, the solid-state NMR data of a homogeneous i2 dodecenine monomer was also observed. However, when the trimer i2-Pro was employed as the catalyst in the same coupling reaction, he gave a major improvement in the enantioselectivity to 85 and 73 ee, respectively. Moreover, use of pyridine

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective -functionalization of simple alkyl halides. The brevity of the reaction between the two possible activators can be shortened by installing the alkyl groups at the end of the tether, providing access to electron-rich -amino ester motifs can reduce the electricity required to activate the electrophile.  The ability to reduce the bond length between two alkyl groups is exemplified by the reduction of the aliphatic carbon stereopend, or by an analogous strategy for the reduction of a tethered alkyl amine. We have recently reported that N-phthalimides can catalyze the asymmetric -reduction of aliphatic carbonyls. For the tactic, we chose a pathway where the activator is a carboxylic acid and the stoichiometric reductant is a base. On the basis of the wellknown Martin treatment of esters as electron-deficient substrates that undergo addition to nitriles, we selected diethyl ethylidenemalonate as the stoichiometric reductant.  The reaction we set out to explore initially is the cyclization shown in eq 2. In analogy to our findings in the inter

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a wide range of amino acids that incorporate tol, alkenyl, or alkoxy functionalities. In this context, we have leveraged photoredox catalysis to achieve the direct a-arylation of amino acids. Specifically, we postulated that the selective a-cyanoalkylation of amino acids could be achieved via a photoredox-mediated, HAT-catalyzed a-heteroatom functionalization of the corresponding a-carbon atoms.  It is well known that the a-Carça complex is a highly structured and stabilized quinform. With this knowledge in hand, we prepared octapeptide I, employing the carrier protein technique. The resulting complex, which bears the delivery proteins, was prepared using the same method as in peptide I. The relative stereochemistry of the two complexes was used as a ratio in screening the octapeptide I against protein.  After analyzing several hundred beads, we found that the selectivity for the b-nitrogen was a modest but important factor, giving rise to the desired product in some cases. The reaction was stopped by addition of a 40-fold mixture of carboxylic acids, which were mostly precatalytic and some of which
====================
Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a variety of aliphatic, optically enriched amino acid derivatives. While improvements in catalyst turnover were observed once the third residue was replaced with a free carboxylic acid in an orthogonal chromatographic wreath, we observed a significant increase in selectivity to 85 and 90 ee, respectively. Control experiments established that the reaction requires light and that BoEs preferentially react with the C4 carbonyl on the face of the diconic glass funnel.  While the contributions of the star were fixed at this point, we wondered if the results were due to an intermediate en route to the catechol and subsequent intersystem crossing. Therefore, we proposed that the intersystem crossing occurred at enantiomerically pure from the solution, which was evolved from the heat-injected enantiomer via two SET events. The ice-exchange event produced an ice-selective catalysis product, and O-methylation of the resulting p-system was proposed. The p-system can be recovered by a two-step sequence involving dibromocarbene and acetone, and the two selectivities were compared.  O-Nucleophiles. The addition of an electron to the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes. Given that juniperidone, a popular scaffold among natural isolates from the Strychnos, Aspidosperma and Remingtonia families, was unknown before the findings that are reported herein. It is notable that a variety of substitution patterns about the alkyl chain interval can be accommodated.  The effect of the reaction concentration on the yield of the a-monoacetal is also examined. Low yields were observed when the reaction is performed in the same manner with multiple equivalents of H 2 O. When the result is favorable, as shown in, the yield of the a-monoacetal is proportionately increased. Under similar conditions, a 2:1 mixture of methylene-and ethyl-substituted enals was also subjected to the photoredox a-arylation protocol, and the desired a-aryl aldehyde products were obtained in good yields.  Mr. Prox. Co. , who is also the co-founder of ReN, demonstrated that this a-amine C-H arylation protocol can be successfully employed to construct five different structurally

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the design of peptides for the asymmetric catalytic Bay-A-Lys-O-methyl-N, N-dimethylammonium benzene. This study was undertaken with the guiding principle that reactions would be conducted in H 2 O with the addition of 2 equiv of the nucleophilic amino acid. Under the optimized conditions, peptide 27 afforded the product in 80 yield, with an er of 91:9.  The development of new methods for chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective chemical bond formation is a primary focus in the field of organic synthesis. Such methods enable construction of the molecular frameworks encountered in compounds of interest in pharmacology and materials science settings, inter alia. As targets for chemical synthesis are often diverse in structure, general methods to synthesize an array of unique compounds are desirable, if not also elusive. The importance of the generation of a variety of molecular scaffolds in a rapid, atom-economical fashion is further underscored by the fact that median incomes in the developing countries are substantially lower than the products reported for products where individual hydroxyl groups are affected by the addition of a single atom. Yet, we also observed that product 31, with the extra-long

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of a variety of natural products with intriguing biological activity. While oxidized indoles are a prodigious class of natural products, efforts to effect catalyst-controlled, enantioselective indole oxidations have suffered from complications associated with chemoselectivity and the propensity for product rearrangement. To address these issues, our group applied Asp-based peptides toward selective synthesis of 3-hydroxyindolenines in a reversible manner. We hypothesized that, upon initial epoxidation of indole 2. 38 with aspartyl peracids, subsequent rearrangement would result in 2. 39. Upon optimization of the reaction conditions, evaluation of a small library of Asp-containing catalysts resulted in the formation of a result: 16 of the desired product 2. 39 was obtained, which proved to be a highly ellipticic product, requiring that 3-hydroxyindolenine be produced in 44 yield. However, use of the diethyl ethylidenemalonate Michael acceptor resulted in a 1:1 ratio of mono 2. 40, which proved to be a more robust actiVity.  Further attempts to optimize the reaction conditions resulted in increased product yield and selectivity. Bu

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes through the combination of iminium ions that can be generated generationally generated. In the absence of iminium ions, the acetate anion can react with the aldehyde to provide a -hydroxyketone, which can be subsequently oxidized by iminium ion 4 to regenerate the free acid. These Karplus derivatives have found use in the prior photoredox a-oxidation of a number of chalcone substrates, primarily GA and NGA. Their application to the alkylimidazole, indole, pyrrolidine, and thiophene substrates was demonstrated with large-volume benzaldehyde and cyclohexanone.  We next examined the scope of the aldehyde component in this enantioselective a-carbonyl a-oxidation protocol. As shown in, a wide range of functional groups can be readily tolerated on the aldehydic substrate. For example, electron-rich alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, ether, ester, amine, and ester moieties are suitable. Moreover, the use of deckylemethylsilyl

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of -minfiensine, a medicinal agent in development for the treatment of ADHD. As shown in Scheme 3, implementation of our standard conditions led to a 1:1 ratio of 6 and 7, affording 7 in 84 y ield at 23C.  Upon investigation into the origins of such a large selectivity, several explanations were bandied. First, the cyclohexyl group of 1 was exposed to alkynes, and the resulting alkyl-substituted alkynes were protonated to catalyze the decarboxylative arylation of 2. This selected acid is capable of protonating 2 to deliver a carbamate, which is known to undergo a variety of ancestral conformations, including ones that were previously documented to be cyclic. In addition, the presence of alkynes was consistent with the possibility that the 2-catalyzed arylation inverts the turn of the pyrrolidine ring.  Second, we determined that the naphthyl-substituted alcohol 8 was an excellent substrate for peptide catalyst 4, affording the product in excellent yield. This result suggests that Pmh-containing peptides are well-suited for

Peptide catalysis can be applied to these theories to a highly complex bioactive peptide catalyst.  The N-phthalimides. Inspired by the work of Ramachandran and co-workers, we assessed the acylation state of the mimics after acylation and found that after 60 min, the acylation state of 7. 25 was observed. However, after 6 h, the beads were alkylated with MeOH, MeOH, and MeOH. The diols were isolated in 27 yield. The ee value of the minor isomer was measured at 75 conversion.  In addition to the N-phthalimides, the macrolides were also generated using the BINOL-derived alkylimidazolium salt. After acylation of N-phthalimide 7. 25, the resulting enamine 7. 26 was isolated in 33 yield. The ee value of the minor arene is measured at 65 conversion. On the basis of the results discussed above, the dienes are stable under alkaline conditions.  It is noteworthy that the only difference between the dienes found throughout this list is the conjugate addition of a terminal dienor to a lipase. It is also relevant

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the design of an enantioselective catalytic variant of the Mitchl-Michael addition. In this case, a trans-lactohexene-1, 3-diol was employed in the reaction with mixed toluene and trifluorotoluene in an aqueous solution at pH 7. Previous work from the Ball group had demonstrated that Rh could be used to activate silyl enolates via in situ generation of bifunctionalized oxetane, and while the approach was immature, help surfaced for iminium catalysis. Recognizing that the analogs of silyl enolates proposed in this work could be constructed aliphatically, the authors began to focus on diastereoselective synthesis of optically pure −diols from silyl enolates.  They proposed a model wherein enamine 8, which loses a ligand to afford drug 9, could be activated by treatment with 10 mol of imidazolidinone 8 and a phenyltetrahl radical generated by one-electron reduction of a N-phthalimide. Spiro transition state 11 would subsequently lead to iminium ion 10, which upon redu

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the desymmetrization of symmetrical bis, which carries out the reaction in question. The reaction proceeds via an atropisomer-selective electrophilic aromatic brominationconjugate addition followed by an atropisomer-selective electrophilic aromatic bromination. The result is an enantioselective synthesis that delivers chiral nonracemic biaryl compounds with excellent optical properties. A specific example of the technique is the synthesis of N, O-acetals derived from racemic acetals. These compounds, in particular, enjoy the attention of the medicinal chemistry community as a result of their mathematical parallels to a number of known compounds.  The application of catalyst control to the stereoselective synthesis of acyclic stereocenters was accomplished in the case of 1, 3-diamine-and 1, 3-diamine-derived scaffolds, as well as in the case of a racemic ortho-substituted enal. Desymmetrization of the racemic mixture was observed on the one hand, as was the enantioselectivity for the phosphorylation of the phenolic moiety. Let us emphasize that the stereochemical outcome in

Peptide catalysis can be applied to this objective. Thex-ray crystal structure of a related D-Pro-Aib-D-Pro-Asp-NM, which was discovered in 2001, can be subjected to the same reaction conditions. In this case, the scaffold is too symmetrical to be completely rigid, and the x-ray crystal structure of 189 was obtained.  The residue that controls the rate of the carbenoid formation, Cys145, is positioned at the N-terminus of a peptide sequence. In this position, a -turn can be formed from the imidazole group in the central position, as shown in. Thep roduct is stabilized by n f interactions between the naphthyl group on substrate and the backbone amide, which is applied to the acceleration of the hydrolysis reaction. E ven though the carbenoid formation is slowed by the introduction of the hydroxide anion, it is not until after adv aling of the amide that the carbenoid product is obtained.

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the late-stage synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. The text is available in the online version of the paper.   DFT calculations were used to examine the solution structures of several interesting compounds and to elucidate their conformational homology. On the basis of this analysis, it can be inferred that the hodgkinsine sugar is closely related to the structure of insoluble Ni. On the other hand, the presence of an silyl ether in the conventional ground state of glycosyl ester suggests that the Ni complex is deactivated. The net effect is to diminish the oxidation potential of the hodgkinsine sugar.  It is not surprising that the presence of an hodgkinsine sugar is advantageous for catalysis. The calculated structure of DFT-L, as well as the consensus structure provided by Dranello and coworkers, support this view. The lattice of the Harmitz-Scheffer, as well as the structure of the Planar-Alder targeted by the patent attorneys, is consistent with a type II -turn. A number of peptides were prepared that could provide hodgkinsine adducts of various structures. It is notable that good selectivity was observed even

Peptide catalysis can be applied to complex peptides. The phosphopeptide 3 catalyst is able to mediate the bromination of several pharmaceutically relevant compounds. In general, this catalysis methodology was applied to maintain the selectivity of the product by varying the size of thephe in the i11. The more complex pThr residue was found to be closer to the intrinsic reactivity, providing product 4. The addition of the methyl group on the i3 side of the pThr residue generates a slightly more reactive system, as P32 in the big series of peptides can mediate the bromination of 2. The peptide B14, in which the brother rotates, gave a product distribution of up to 1. 0:4. 1:1. 3. The same site selectivity was observed previously with this substrate. On the other hand, a significant increase in selectivity was observed when B14 was used. The C8-urea now gives a nearly equal ratio of products, whereas the C16-amide gives the product in low e. r. The all-asparagine peptide now only presents itself as a slightly more reactive structure or as a more mixed site. It is possible that for some substrates

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the enantioselective a-oxidation of many substrates to generate a range of a-hydroxyketone products. In the initial stages of reaction, the key a-oxy group undergoes a-oxidation to the corresponding oxetane, which can be oxidized by copper with the air. This oxetane can then be displaced to deliver a-oxyamino aldehydes. These a-oxyamino aldehydes can then be used as chiral ligands for copper-catalyzed aryl-aryl bond formation. 10 As in the a-oxyamination reaction, catalyst screening studies have revealed that product distribution is important with 3-phenyl-substituted substrate 11, where the reaction is more rapid and high in yield.  Copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have also been applied to the CH functionalization of naphthyl-substituted alcohols. Reactions with dibromodimethylhydantoinwere performed at 30C to afford the corresponding arylation products in 90 yield. The low oxidation potential of substrates such as dibromodimethylhydantoin allows for the use of readily available cath

Peptide catalysis can be applied to a broad range of amino acids, to generate allylic amines in high yield and with excellent stereoselectivity.  Our investigation into the intramolecular Stetter following Apple Pie was undertaken with the goal of identifying two sets of catalytic conditions: one that would favor the formation of the mono-glucosyl product, and an orthogonal set that would favor the regioisomer, 3-thiocarbonate. Screening of the unpurified catalysts at room temperature for the secondary alcohol was initially conducted with water, as we hypothesized that a foEM-activated iminium acid would lead to the desired secondary alcohol while simultaneously generating a "homobenzylic ketone. Our studies were successful in assessing the proofs of concept. When the reaction was performed with the unsaturated ketone, we observed a four-fold improvement in the reaction efficiency, whereas addition of methanol resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the overall level of ketone.  Furthermore, we found that the product of the reaction was intermediate between the two sets of catalytic conditions, suggesting that catalyst 2t afforded the product in the (The identification of a catalyst that is able to selectively functionalize the G 6

Peptide catalysis can be applied to more complex settings, including the synthesis of intermolecular fights. Building on prior work by bringing together the structural and functional analysis tools in the i1 and i2 sections, we assessed the relative energies of the three structures that comprise 98 are balanced by 11. The computed energies are consistent with a conformation in which
ring 4 is involved in a strong, intramolecular Hbond. The conformation of the catalyst in the presence of substrates differs from the simple BINAP variant, which bears a simple 1, 3-diamine. The all-asparagine tripeptide shell is significantly more disfavored relative to the -hairpin geometries in the context of peptide 3 than it is in the i2 complex. This underscores an influence of the i2 residue on the all-asparagine octapeptide shell.  It is important to note that the only difference between the fully characterized all-asparagine peptide and the corresponding naphthyl-based analogue is the quantity of the para-determined by the vs. Of all the major diastereomers, peptides 3 and 4 contain the dimentium residue at the i2 position, while only

Peptide catalysis can be applied to crosscouplings between enolates and enones by employing isothermal xenorobutanone 2. Isolated yields are obtained in good yields and selectivities using octanal, 1-hexanol and ppgmhyl d_methylene as arenes.  The ability to dial in functional groups on the aldehydic component gives rise to ensembles that vary in lattice size and oxidation state. For example, a variety of aliphatic aldehydes can be employed in this new coupling reaction to provide addition products 135 using 10 mol quinuclidine. Of the isopropyl aldehydes found in this composition, only the phenyl isomer is believed to be isolated with significant quantity, as it is highly unstable and prone to hydrolysis.  The ability to observe the properties of the interiors of macrocycles has been replaced by ultrasonic frequencies that show the passes of the inner membrane. Typically, these frequencies are observed as shifts in the UV-zone, where the inner membrane appears to be localized in an increased distance from the electron-deficient center of the cysteine. The isoallimum has been estimated to be as close to zero as the distances from the

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the gradual discovery of new medicinal agents within the realm of the synthesis of proteins.  Note Added in Proof. Shortly prior to publication it came to the authors attention that an enantioselective boron-catalyzed ketone alkylation has been accomplished. This work will be submitted for communication in the near future. Joel M. Hawkins, Pfizer Global Research, personal communication.  Scheme 2 provides a graphical representation of the full catalytic cycle based on the mechanistic analysis described above. Reaction of 3 with one equivalent of 1 produces enamine 5 and an equivalent of H 2. The equilibrium is shifted towards 5 by the Lewis acid and is reversed by H 2. Thus, the enamine and H 2 are both neutral in the transition state, and the amide NH is oriented towards the same face as the rest of the peptide. The POE-interacts with the hydroxyl-face of the other carbonyl, facilitating the transition state to 5.  The global equilibrium is shifted towards 6 by the Lewis acid, and is reversed by H 2. Thus, the enamine and H 2 are both neutral in the transition state, and the amide NH is oriented towards the same face as the rest

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the total synthesis of -aplyviolene.  Mechanistically, the aplyviolene core fragment is readily available in homogeneous form through a two-step two-step sequence involving dibromocarbene followed by an amine-mediated additioncyclization event. For this reason, we expected the synthesis of aplyviolene to be rapidly completionable utilizing peptide-catalyzed cross-coupling protocols. With this focus in mind, we initiated studies to specify the steps involved in the synthesis of aplyviolene.  On the preparation of aplyviolene, a sample thereof waspdirthed with dibromodimethylhydantoin and any remaining aqueous H 2 O 2. The sample was immediately subjected to SuzukiMiyaura coupling with aqueous NH 4 Cl to provide the difluoroglutamic acid 27, which was immediately protected as the acetate ester. The sample was then treated with Ni 2 and DIC to provide the diisopropylbenzofuran solution. This base washed with Ni 2 and DIC has a very similar scale to the Ni 2 -mediated additioncyclization. After drying in a PCR tube, these beads were

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the derivatization of a variety of other complex peptides, including a-allenic esters, which incorporate a-allenic esters. Peptide catalysis can also be employed to oxidize -dioxygenated esters. The reaction displayed in eq 1 was silenced by addition of water, which occurred before the product was isolated.  The reaction exhibited a shift to favor the a-side product 3a in a 1:10 ratio. This ratio decreased as the holomethyl group around Gln189 was replaced with tosyl group, which was found to be a much more effective at protecting IMPase activity.  Since the initial phosphine-and amine-catalyzed reactions were performed at room temperature, the left-hand tripeptide was able to catalyze the reductive aminations of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde at higher temperatures without an increase in selectivity.  In addition to the reaction exhibited by the allenic ester, the leucine-Catalyzed oxygen addition of nitroalkanes to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds would be an ideal next step. The reaction of nitroalkanes

Peptide catalysis can be applied to the further development of this powerful Friedel-Crafts Strategy. In this vein, we anticipated that the Friedel-Crafts mechanism might be specifically applicable to the case of indolines, in accord with our findings.  Our enantioselective organocatalytic Friedel-Crafts were first examined in the context of N-phenylpiperazine-containing compounds. PEMP is oppressed to produce a pyrrolidine in situ. This pyrrolidine conjugate addition is rate-determining, and amounts of product may be obtained in perpetuity.  Over the past two decades, the field of enantioselective catalysis has witnessed tremendous progress in the successful implementation of small organic molecules as asymmetric catalysts. In particular, two modes of catalytic activation by chiral secondary amines have led to the discovery of enantioselective reactions: first, the site-selective conjugate addition of chiral secondary amines to winnowruine at 0C, and second, the site-selective conjugate addition of a chiral secondary amine to the reagent containing a stereogenic center. While the details of the EAS mechanism are complicated
