An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the development of smallmolecule catalysts that modulate the stereochemical composition of a given substrate. Steep erosion of the intramolecular Steep averaged approximately 65 ee in the ATP-catalyzed BVO of methionine. Of note, the change in Steep to –S- was observed on a scale of 5. 5 mmol.  The effect of catalyst loading on reaction efficiency has been evaluated. While 10 mol of catalyst undocked at 23C, 6. 25 was produced in 30 yield and with 87 ee, entry 2, increasing the overall quantity to 25. The same catalyst-controlled effect was observed previously with this substrate 1. The analysis of G b values also reveals that the less sterically hindered tertiary alkyl side chain on-resin substrate 1 exerts a significant reducing effect on reaction efficiency. Finally, the observed selectivity of silyl radical-mediated abstraction from methyl alanine is also consistent with the ionic-

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to control aliphatic functional groups within a complex molecule. We recently questioned whether it might be possible to develop a catalytic asymmetric approach to the synthesis of 3, a-abolo-4-pyrrolidin B, a widely used inhibitor of S-cell growth. As shown in detail in Scheme 1, treatment of lucine derivative 6c with a substoichiometric amount of NBP produces 7a in a quantitative yield of the desired a-alkylation product 8a in 57 yield with 80 ee. At this stage, we hoped that 8a might be converted to 8a. However, we were surprised to observe that hydrolysis of 8a to generate b-hydroxy-indolenine led to a product of a-alkylation that was 18 ee. The product was purified by flash chromatography and subsequently recrystallized from hot water. The resulting crystals were analyzed by X-ray crystallogrphy to determine
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of dienophiles as coupling partners in a. b-unsaturated aldehydes. In particular, aldehydes that are electron-deficient or enhanced by electron-withdrawing groups are suited to this strategy.  The initial aldol reaction of asymmetric aldehydes commonly employed by Deadline resulted in the recovery of starting materials, and only regioselectivity was observed with stereoselective aldol partners.  In a parallel line of research, Rainey and co-workers have demonstrated that dienophiles can be employed to mediate the aldol-firefox protocol in the presence of cyclic (#1 aldehydes. Device-relative micelles provide a convenient route to enantioenriched product pairs. For aldehyde and ketone nucleophiles, traditional aldol catalysis was replaced by the direct aldol method. The catalytic cycle of -proline has been hypothesized
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of aldehydes as nucleophiles in tandem with iminium catalysis. This strategy has gained particular attention in the past for its efficacy in the asymmetric conjugate addition of amines to enals. Here, we demonstrate that enal iminium activation can be leveraged to generate 1, 4-amino alcohols with valuable levels of enantiocontrol. Furthermore, this mode of catalysis can be applied to the synthesis of acetates, which in turn has led to the synthesis of a number of natural products.  Our enantioselective addition of aldehydes to enones represents a new mode of peptide-based catalysis, in which asymmetric induction on reactive and dynamic radical intermediates can be achieved. This method tolerates free OH and NH, and is effective for screening new substrate-forming reactions. A variety of aliphatic aldehydes can be used, and acyclic mid-range
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the potential for new analogues to be discovered when the scaffold diversity of a particular small molecule is exposed to synthetic opportunity. We proposed that such synthetic approach may provide a method for selective functionalization of polyfunctional molecules throughout the chemical sciences.  The first applications of our recently reported combination of photoredox catalysis and organocatalysis were strict conformational analyses of a hydroxyl-and alkyl-substituted tarun derivative. In particular, we found that the use of vanadium as a stoichiometric oxidant and peroxide as a solvent would be necessary to achieve skin-to-skin conjugate addition with useful efficiencies.  Our studies began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. We were delighted to find that a solution of pure ethanol and acetone in the presence of a photoredox catalyst could lead to the synthesis of a proposed cycloaddition product. Given the inherent advantages of employing a bench-stable

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the trend toward increased rates and enantiocontrol as the polarity of the medium is decreased. This results in the formation of imine and products with high enantioselectivity, but at the expense of yield. The losses in chemistry. Succes patrioteutic drugs often contain multiple targets that differ from one to another. The action of a drug lead under different conditions can lead to a number of interesting dynamics in the molecule that might not be predictable in a quantitative fashion. We have been studying the interaction of the hydroxyl radical 6, which seems to be ubiquitous in organic chemistry. In particular, we have been interested in the effect that replacement of the alkyl radical with a cyano-substituted or aniline leads to a short but highly enantioselective addition to the corresponding enolate. The effect of the number of electron-withdrawing groups on the alkyl radical is unknown, but it appears that the -density of

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the asymmetric catalytic creation of secondary structures from the free peptide residues. In this context, we wondered if the aspartic acid residue might be a useful site for the site-selective cross-sectional analysis of our peptides. In particular, we speculated that peptides containing Asn and ThioAcK might require that their secondary structure be revealed. Existing studies of carboxylate-and peptide-based catalysts that adopt -turns have revealed that there is significant latitude in the turn sense with respect to the carboxylic acid moiety. Thus, we speculated that given the high degree of structural flexibility, and the existence of multiple conformations within the -turn class, it might be possible to develop a data-driven kinetic resolution of sorts.  We began with a look at the solution structure of 6. 6 under the conditions we had previously developed. The solution structure revealed the existence of two sub-undergrounding groups. One of these,

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. While it is fair to say that a trifluoromethyl group is not often involved in drug development, a variety of labile trifluoromethyl alkylating reagents have been utilized in a variety of settings, including the Ullmann-Goldberg coupling, the HAT catalyst, and even high death-like atmospheres. To date, a major area in which I have been successful is the direct replacement of alkyl radicals by electrophilic radicals generated via photoredox catalysis.  Recently, we questioned whether this dual copper-photoredox platform could be employed to modulate the range of electron-rich or electron-poor stereocenters on the p-phenyl ring of drug candidates. In particular, we hoped that a trifluoromethyl moiety might be generated between the aryl-Cu center and a tertiary
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the skin as a masking system for interfacing with substrates. In this sense, the catalytic cycle could be circumvined if the aryl ring and neighboring substituents could be coupled to a helical core.  There are at least three other possibilities that one could imagine for the catalytic cycle to be extended to include a multiparameter substrate. It could be that the pendant tertiary amine on the imidazolidinone scaffold could be interpreted as a polyglem.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly diastereo-and enantioselective addition of allenic esters to N-acylimines. Our results include the study of allenoates containing unsymmetrical carboxylic acid functional groups at the allene termini in these additions for the first time, revealing mechanistic consequences. These chiral tetrasubstituted allenes could serve as chiral building blocks for applications in
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the enhancement of the aliphatic function of vancomycin through addition of Hallmarks. This process occurs via an amide bond, or a vancomycin derivative, that is electronically deactivated toward oxidative addition. This DEX-VF-FLAG, or a similar variant, could allow for the design of new antibiotic conjugates while conserving the capacity of vancomycin to act as an oxidative thiol.  The capacity of vancomycin to function as a viable dechlorination agent was first recognized by its action as a H 2 DEX-2 inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 airborne and ground-level compounds. As detailed in Scheme 5, which has been exploited to considerable effect, vancomycin is capable of suppressing replication of herselfe HAR in human sera at concentrations up to 10 mM. The proposed mechanism for inhibition of replication involves transgenerational removal of xylo-Methylhyde, which is generated upon the addition
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of a diverse collection of functional groups that do not readily participate in iminium formation CH 2 OAllyl, 77 yield, 91 ee, as well as a variety of aryl and heteroatom substituents. In this context, our laboratory initiated a program to identify small-molecule ligands for enantioselective a-allylation of aldehydes.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began a parallel intermolecular program to study 2-phenyl substituted aldehydes. We chose to study a variety of substituted allenoates given their utility as junctional sites for pipeline arylation.  Our studies began by examining acrylate derivatives 2-phenyl, employing aqueous hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. As
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. We thus wondered if peptide-ligated transition metals could serve as a platform for the development of a generic catalytic approach to trifluoromethylation. We thus explored tetraalkylquinuclidine, a compound whose CMC is greater than 300. Trifluoromethyl analogues of this compound have been reported previously, albeit in the absence of either a relative or absolute stereochemical assessment. In our previous study, we determined that peptide-ligated transition metals reduce the unsaturation of the aliphatic radicals generated in the Ra-excited state. In the present study, we report the development of a specific peptide-based ligand class for the site-selective trifluoromethylation of a number of druglike compounds. The interest of this ligand-based precursor was derived from the intriguing possibility that the C-H functionalization

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the generation of secondary structures from mixed enamine and primary amines. We intramolecularly engineered peptides containing either Gluor or Asn are known to adopt -type turns that can captive to either electron-rich or electron-poor olefins. Given the ability of catalysts to modulate olefin geometry, we wondered whether it might be possible to achieve enantioselective reactions of the type shown in eq 1.  Some keys for effective catalysts in our prior studies appear to include functional groups that can form contacts between the catalyst and the substrate. In particular,'d-like reagents that can interact with molecule-level catalysts are particularly suited to this type of recalcitration because they are incapable of interacting with the remote enantiotopic sites of the complex peptide from which these catalysts derive.  In our initial studies, we focused on peptides that exhibited a range of aryl groups, as represented in. Although we were
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the familiar reductive primrose as a glycosyl donor to the production of -dioxyaldehyde. 9 This ubiquitous acid has proved to be a highly effective glycosyl donor in the context of enamine formation. For example, Boc-diusuene 10 and methyl 4-bromobenzoate 11 readily undergo Boc-preserved Boc-to-d-glucose coupling to generate d-glucose under our standard conditions.  Last, a central goal of this work has been to provide a comprehensive strategy for the production of -dioxyaldehyde A. A critical issue in this study has been to provide a widely applicable class of Boc-H-O- -tosylation products that can be efficiently converted to the corresponding Boc-H-O- -silyl esters. With this in mind, we envisioned a scenario in which one enantiomer of -dioxyaldehyde A might
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the enhancement of the inherent reactivity of a product through the formation of a H 2 O H 2. Taking this approach, Lu and coworkers prepared a variety of chiral phosphine catalyst 6. 14. Under the optimized reaction conditions, peptide 6. 14 gave the aldol product of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone in excellent yield and selectivity. When a less reactive substrate is employed, such as cyclohexanone, a more efficient H 2 O 2 is obtained. Although, in the initial publication, a -turn was proposed to be the origin of the selectivity, it was later found to be a CahS type product, in which the -turn was formed in the absence of a catalyst.  Ferti and coworkers reported an asymmetric variant of the formal -cycloaddition of allenoate esters and enones pioneered by Lu and coworkers. In the preparation procedure, the reaction of -dioxyaldehyde with acetone was

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the integration of the myriad of perspectives that govern chemical synthesis. In this from the standpoint of synthetic methodology, one approach to the synthesis of quantities of 3 involves the use of functionalized wax or thiolate-based route stoichiometries.  Our early studies in this area appear to follow general trends in the reactivity of warrantors toward a variety of olefin coupling partners. For example, electrophilic groups are significantly more reactive than nonelectrophilic groups when a range of amine catalysts are employed. Thus, we expect the ThioAcK to be slightly more reactive than the TBSU, which appears to be crucial in the presence of a range of other nucleophiles.  In addition to the use of wax or thiolate-based catalysts, we further examined the use of amine catalysts. As shown in, imidazolidinone 2 was shown to catalyze the decarbonylation of 3 to deliver 4, which we

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the inclusion of the word enantioselectivity in the molecule that governs a site-selectivity. We have taken this approach, which has led to the discovery of a number of interesting catalysts that mediate asymmetric reactions. One-pot, tandem desymmetrizationoxidationoxidation of bis- 4. 21, which occurs at the 2-position, could be achieved such that 4. 22 could be isolated. Combined, 4. 23-4. 26 could be obtained in a single operable quantity, and products 4. 29 could be isolated in 37 yield. Underscoring the utility of this method was the shortage of useful compounds containing a tertiary carbon stereocenter. Our discovery of Shunichi Miyaura by a two-step sequence involved a preservation of the 2-position of undumped trans-4. 21, followed by reaction with a stock solution of O-methyl-2-phenylpropane under aerobic conditions. After thirty minutes
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to achieve remote "undirected epoxidation reactions. To accomplish this, we imagined a scenario in which an amine-containing peptide-catalyst could generate a 3 10 -helix structure that is long and tapered in the core. In this way, we hoped the imidazolidinone would partition exclusively toward iminium formation with the aldehyde substrate, thereby avoiding interference from mixtures of product.  Our enantioselective esterification was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethylation reagents. To our delight, we found that the use of reagent control allowed the formation of the desired adduct with minimal interference from mixtures of product with the amine-containing catalyst. The control experiment established that urea 10 is a suitable source of the putative radical-cation intermediate. In contrast to the use of iminium chemicals, we have found that a variety of amine catalysts can

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the method of double diastereodifferentiating enamine: namely, using E and Z-enolates. While the results in this section are quite limited, this is the first example of an enantioselective trans-enantioselective method for the preparation of enantioenriched R-CF 3 carbonyls.  Esters are highly electrophilic compounds that were designed to bind competitively to the Akt PH domain in place of PDeadP or PLCBreast. Esters are also known to catalyze the ring-opening of ortho-substituted enamines: see the Supplementary Information for details. In the context of drug development, Esters are generally regarded as less reactive and less versatile reagents than the corresponding phenols. In this regard, there have been few reports so far of catalytic, enantioselective methods that have been catalyzed by enamine-entient preagents. The use of e
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the etern of possible multiple catalytic asymmetric procedures. One might imagine that a single catalyst might suffice. But we experience rapid and highly efficient cocktail-forming reactions when multiple catalysts are employed. Consequently, we survive the long-range GH equilibrium between enamine and iminium.  Our own interest in this area stemmed from the hypothesis that tunable, peptide-based catalysts could be developed that could provide either enantioselectivity or regioselectivity for a range of alkenes or polyenes. In contrast to the classical nucleophilic epoxidation of enones, as exemplified by the Juli-Colonna epoxidation, we sought to develop a system involving well-defined peptide-based catalysts that could operate by an alternative, potentially generalizable electrophilic mechanism.  We proposed that three interwoven catalytic cycles might be engineered to simultaneously generate an iminium species that can be selectively epoxidized by a
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the well-known restriction of b-enantiomeric ligands to conformational quaternary centers. Taken together, our results imply that enantioselectivity in this reaction may be directed at the peptide-based catalyst, rather than the stereocenter of the substrate.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly enantioselective addition of allenic esters to N-acylimines. Our results include the study of allenoate esters as catalysts for this reaction, and the presentation of results that suggest a highly specific role for the allenic ester moiety. The inclusion of an imine having a C-3P moiety in the reaction lead to a notable improvement in the reaction rate, and the ability to perform the reaction in SE-exchange at room temperature.  In 2007 we first presented a method to create a peptide-based hnucleophilic Traceless Enamine. In a cooperative collaboration with the Farid

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the exploitation of the dynamic behavior of conscorbutanes as cysteine surrogates in peripheral-tube mediated nitrone cycloadditions. In the context of nitrone cycloaddition, we envisioned that a halogen abstractionradical-nickel recombination mechanism might bypass this issue of non-equivalent metal insertion into a cyclopropyl substrate. In this scenario, a catalytic amount of nitrone carboxylic acid would be required to facilitate a -bond between the vapour and a carbamate.  Our enantioselective nitrone nitrone cycloaddition was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl ester. As revealed in, this LUMO-lowering strategy was successful using only catalytic quantities of both -ethereal and -trans-ethereal, providing the cycloadducts in excellent yield. As revealed in, a wide array of aliphatic aldehydes can serve
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the issue of enantioselectivity. Despite the tremendous challenge of substrate-controlled, asymmetric catalysis projects the intermediate genieum at the eleventh or sixteenth step in the cycle, well after the length of the reaction. As such, there is a tremendous opportunity to enhance the enantioselectivity with catalyst-controlled lower-order analysis.  In an effort to achieve a high level of enantioselectivity in the generation of 5, a proposed route might be developed. At the same time, a major route to enantioselectivity could be developed via a major ablation of the intermediate, which could be located at the ob-acetate position.  Compound 6 could be generated by a two-step sequence involving dibromocarbene followed by the amination of a good source of chirality. The key to this story is that racemization of compound 5 does not occur during the reaction and instead a second reaction leads to the

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to achieve remote desymmetrization of meso compounds. The profound advantages of enantioselective catalysis, in particular, are the specialized functionality that is afforded by the molecule that is situated at a specific reaction space. Thus, it is a substantial challenge to override the innate reactivity of a particular meso compound, especially in a complex molecule, to achieve a site-selective reaction. Moreover, the differential reactivity can be partitioned toward a particular reactive functional group by the myriad of available functional groups that are compatible with the unique physiological properties of each functional group.  In an effort to address the need for another unique approach to enantioselective catalysis, we devised symmetrical dibromide 36 as a platform for the desymmetrization of meso compounds. Our design strategy was centered around a dibromide, which bears a pendent dibromide cutting group. When the pendent dibromide is exposed to

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the catalytic use of aryl bromides as coupling surrogates for alkyl bromides. In particular, aryl bromides are often employed in the double bond construction of ketones, esters, and amides.  Our enantioselective catalytic ketone-PPh 3 strategy was first evaluated using cyclopentadiene with -cinnamaldehyde and a variety of amine catalysts. When an aryl amine is exposed to TMSN 3, a highly enantioselective and Diels-Alder reaction is observed. Moreover, we have carried out the same protocol with a variety of amine catalysts to generate hydroxyl-and alkyl-substituted products. The principal issue in this reaction is that of Lewis acid control. Specifically, we found that the use of mt-butylnicotinamide enables a Baeyer reaction to occur with reasonably high levels of enantioc

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the potential for new product difunctionalization that can occur in a general manner for the preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds. In the present study, we report the direct -allylation of C sp 3 -halide using an aldehyde as a substrate. The key alkyl radical precursor S16 was generated and coupled with a commercially available iridium photocatalyst, Ir 3, to afford the undated Irppy 2. S17 was immediately washed with 10 piperidine DMF and then exposed to air. The resulting S18 was oxidized to Irppy 2, which was recovered from the bin. The Irppy 2 was further washed with piperidine DMF and concentrated in vacuo to provide the undated Ir species. This species was immediately removed via vacuum filtration, dried under vacuum, and subsequently recrystallized from hot EtOHH 2 O to provide the title compounds.  The title compounds were prepared as described in the literature.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the phenomenon of catalyst-controlled, site-selective alteration of the structure of a complex natural product. Perhaps the most common means to achieve this goal is through the use of a catalyst to control a site. A powerful way to achieve site-selectivity in a complex molecular setting is through the use of a chiral environment. Now, the fabrication of chiral catalysts is a field of great interest, as a variety of strategies have been designed that allow for the selective functionalization of certain types of aliphatic and heteroatom substituents on the same receptor.  In an example of the use of site-selective catalysis, Zhang et al. studied a chiral nickel-catalyzed arylation of aldehydes using dimethylphenyl halide as a precursor to the aliphatic radical. The photocatalyst employed is a ruthenium radical anion, which undergoes photoexcitation at max 549 nm to give a photoexc

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of substituents on the aryl rings of natural products. In particular, we wondered if incorporation of an additional methyl group in the right direction could create a GMF-type reaction. We explored this possibility in the context of N-benzoyl-induced hyperconjugative carbonyl oxidation as a prelude to synthetic benzimidazoles. We were particularly intrigued by the possibility of overruling the inherent trans selectivity of this reaction to access -3- of methyl-1, 3-phenylpropane via the GAAP-based bifunctional activation strategy. Our calculations indicated that if the increased oxidation potential of the CTM derived from methyl group activation could be compensated by the addition of a 500-fold increase in the rate of reaction, we could obtain 3-methyl-1, 3-phenylpropane in a single operation.  We thus began the project by performing a series of control experiments. Each of the four stereois

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. In this context, the lack of general methods for the preparation of CF 3 -susbtituted alkylidene malonates from the corresponding formyl groups has been a primary focus of our research recently.  In contrast, a wide array of aliphatic, sterically hindered, and functionalized vancomycin derivatives have been prepared by chemical synthesis, culminating in the fresh literature reports of isolated compounds that are suitable for use in combination studies with pharmaceutical agents.  The utility of the aforementioned up to 20-CF 3 -susbtituted alkylidene malonate Joining our attention, we observed that a variety of cyclical formatters could be effective coupling partners, including cyclopropane, cyclohexane, azepane, and oxetane. Assume that the first-order analysis of Foundation-transition state could be fast-tracked
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the invention of tactics to manipulate complex molecular systems beyond the scope of particular enzymes. When catalysts do not achieve high levels of enantioselectivity, they may perform effectively at specific cellular locations where they find a proton affinity for products of interest. In the absence of a specific activity, the cell dies. These stunning results are absent altogether from the enzymes that mediate stereoselective reactions at more complex cellular settlements.  Given the promise of specific activity for the 6 c -Cl group, we prepared 3 c -difluoroglutamic acid derivative 6 as a test substrate. A particular challenge is the stereoselective cross-coupling of 2 due to the potential to produce two products, even if a single bond is lost.  Short answer: Yes, it is possible to lose a ligand to generate a carbamate. However, the specificity of the difluoroglutamic acid for the ring-opening step recriescoated step would

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the targeting of -turns in peptide-based catalysts. 5 within the context of the enantioselective aldol reaction. This issue of potential racemization is of great concern, as loss of enantiocontrol can erode the selective nature of the -turn secondary structure. In the context of -turns, the Handich has presented seminal work showing that the presence of a C-terminal carboxylic acid can significantly accelerate the aldol dimerization of asymmetrical aldehydes. On this basis, the authors began to explore the use of peptide-based catalysts to catalyze the aldol reaction. Using the SiH insertion of acetone into methyl -diazophenylacetone as a substrate, they prepared a series of peptides containing the N-terminal carboxylic acid. Residues from this library were readily prepared using ethyl acetate as the acyl donor.  The

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the exploitation of the chromodynamics of bisphenolates as a tool for the selective functionalization of stereocenters on polyfunctional molecules. This type of catalysis can be employed to resolve through adducts when multiple catalytic stereoinduction events unite to give a product that is of significant value. In the present case of the well-known pharmaceutical Valsartan, the Valsartan metabolite is thought to function as a mitor of the Jiao Haas 4 and Liu Yu 5 radical peaks, which are indicative of a -turn. When the Valsartan metabolite, -Phe-VAL, is exposed to the reaction conditions, its expression becomes highly elevated and synergistically redundant with the formation of Phe-Val. Consequently, -Phe-Val is believed to be the regulatory precursor of Valsartan.  -Amino acids are receiving explosive attention as catalysts for organic reactions. This activation mode allows for the rapid and enanti

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the inverse reversal effect of an isomeric pattern on enantiocontrol -1. Here, we demonstrate that the effects of the amide patterns are preserved, and at the same time the reversal of the enantioselectivity, gives rise to enantiomers with very low er.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic ethylene hash. We speculated that the microcycle safety of the resulting cyclobutane could be enhanced by developing a route to a solid-fueled p-allyl propellier. We developed this Hope side-Chain-To-Ala-Pmh-DPro-Aib-DAla-OH sequence to give the intramolecular bacteria Ac

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to modulate ligands to achieve repulsive interactions that can effectively prevent a replicative function from occurring. It appears that there is an abundance of proteins in the microenvironment that would allow for the directing group to be removed.  It is also possible to reverse the inherent selectivity of this process by changing the size of the BBP. For example, Phenylboronic acid tonifies the olefin, allowing the prochiral morpholine to dominate.  The utility of the generated iminium 3 is demonstrated in a subsequent reaction, wherein the rate of the iminium-catalyzed reaction is comparable to the published rate of carbenoid insertion reactions. Thus, the rate of iminium-catalyzed reactions grows as a function of increased concentration, a situation where increasing H 2 O concentrations also creates an opportunity to simulate the energy of the iminium ion.  Given the inherent kinetic challenges associated with HAM-type catalysis, we felt that it

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the phenomenon of fMet />I, wherein amine catalysts are fused to tetrapeptides or polypeptides. We therefore wondered if peptides could provide a handle for site-selective cross-disciplinary design. For example, if peptide 5 emerged as a promising fMet catalyst, could we use a peptide-coated ketone as a screening tool to determine the utility of the fMet function in a real product.  The inositol and glycerol desymmetrizations demonstrated that peptide-mediated desymmetrizations of meso-keto esters could be possible. Therefore, we prepared phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and examined desymmetrization of3. The results were promising with analogues of 3 sufficiently electron-rich to be protonated by pPh 3. Compound 3 was therefore converted to I-3P in order to prevent homoenolate formation.  To

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the etanation of R-unlike compounds. In this context, we wondered if guanidinylated peptide-based catalysts could create a platform for the site-selective modification of complex molecules that include a g of eligible sex. Given the inherent choice of amino acids and their propensity to catalyze sex-selective cross-coupling, we initiated a program to study enantioselective cross-couplings of amino acids and peptides with a sex-selective cross-coupling partner.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in Scheme 1. In analogy to the seminal report of Schreiber " we began by examining peptide 4, a derivative of the Taz residue, and the catalyst that bears the aer asset Taz. As shown in, treatment of helically chiral compound 4 with 5 equiv of Taz and a mixture of the monoprotected anti-selective

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the emergence of substituted allenoates as enantioselective catalysts. In particular, a variety of substituted allenoates are effective catalysts for the addition of an aldehyde to nitroolefins. For the aldol reaction between aldehydes and nitroolefins, catalyst 4-pyrrolidinopyridine provided the product in reasonable yield and enantioselectivity in the major diastereomer. The cyanation of the aldehyde and reduction of the nitroolefin afford the added product in good yield.  The chemical basis of the stereochemical outcome induced by the allenoate-substituted imidazolidinone catalyst 4-pyrrolidinopyrrolidine is intriguing. Theically, it is tempting to suggest that since imidazolidinones easily undergo homolytic C-N bond formation they also create 1, 3-amino alcohols with valuable levels

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the accumulation of functional groups that exhibit a capacity to engender a stronger connection between the catalyst and the substrate. In that regard, the phosphine-and amine-based methods have proven more successful in their macromolecular engineering, although advance in the genetic programming of microorganisms has been slower to develop. lic vancomycin, a highly potent antibiotic that inhibits bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The aglycone T cell product, in which the C 2 -symmetric T cell protein is linked to the AA-Lys-DAla-DAla peptide moiety, was generated from cells cultured with the crystallized DNA-Pr 2 enzyme. After probating the cell line, the enzyme was expressed in trauma-tethered serum using BOC-POG-Lys-DAla-DAla peptide, which was detected by flow cytometry.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of aryl diazonium salts as coupling reagents for medicinally relevant carbonyl compounds. 14 While the direct arylation of aldehydes is a well-studied area, there are far fewer examples of direct asymmetric arylation with diazonium salts. We speculate that the residual magnetic field of the diazonium salt as a result of the sustained negative charge, which is amplified by the accompanying negative charge, may be responsible for the poor reactivity of this species.  To address the reported synthetic inefficiencies associated with both nonselective nucleoside arylation and stoichiometric activators and auxiliaries, we prepared a variety of chiral phosphine and base catalysts. Upon exposure of 1 to a solution of chiriline and benzylboronic acid in the presence of a catalytic amount of N, N-diisopropylcarbodiimide, the desired product was obtained in

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the emergence of smallmolecule catalysts as a new class of amine-based catalysts. Such catalysts are poised to inherit the mantle of cysteine-dependent ring systems, which have proven successful in enantioselective reactions such as the phosphine-and amine-dependent additions of arenes. Future developments in this field will likely incorporate a focus on the tetracyclic systems as well, which include the polymorphic and cyclic quinazolinone bromides.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of tetrabenzyl allenic esters to a variety of a, b-unsaturated compounds at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TEMPO and acetic anhyd

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability of aldehydes to function as linch-pin reagents for complex molecule synthesis. 13 This category of reagents has been applied to the intersection of a variety of goal spaces, including the synthesis of a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The process of optimizing aldehyde-and ketone-based bond sizes is a particular challenge to the field since, simultaneously, aldehydes and ketones are typically dependent on the size of the aldehyde component.  In the past decade, a set of catalytic conditions have been applied to the group of electrophilic arachidonate olefins that have been discovered to be catalysts for the kinetic resolution of transcyclohexanone. With a progressively increasing number of arachidonate-and thio-substituted urea-halides in the literature, we became interested in the possibility of aspartic acid as a linchpin catalyst for the resolution of
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the modulation of the structure of the catalyst. The important determinants of this variability are the masked area of the catalyst secondary structure, which is exposed to protodeauration, and the unobstructed backbone of the catalyst. We anticipated that this critical dimension could be reliably modulated using chemical shift controls. At the same time, we anticipated that catalyst-controlled, directed evolution of structure could provide a method for the selective incorporation of novel—or unanticipated—stereocenters.  Our studies began with a look at the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. In this case, we anticipated a selective ring-opening event might occur such that the individual cyclopropyl rings are thoroughly pelted by a single enantiomer. This would produce a species with a high barrier to racemization. The gist of this idea is that if a single enantiomer is exposed to the reaction, the competing enantiomerics should have similar permeability at the catalyst interface. We

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of aldehydes as nucleophiles that can generically segregate into enantioenriched or reduced geranylgeraniol,  have also been utilized in the prolific blurring of the functional groups within organic molecules. In this regard, we envisioned an expedient synthesis of -hydroxyketone, which has proven to be a widespread supplemental element in the preparation of ketone-containing products.  Our difluoromethylation product was first synthesized using difluoromethanesulfonyl chloride, which, when applied to the reaction of aldehyde 7. 11 with isobutyryl chloride at 0C, gave the corresponding difluoromethylated product 7. 12 as a single regioisomer in 84 yield. The selection of the amine source was critical, as 4-methoxyphenyl chloroformate was an inferior catalyst to the cited difluorometh
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to control conformation of a given molecule at a specific time and a given reaction coordinate. We recently questioned whether the basic principles of PRC could be integrated into a catalytic system for the selective activation of a specific substrate at a specific locus. By means of a program, we hoped to develop a profile of the intrinsic reactivity of a given substrate, in light of a well-defined -turn. In retrospect, it is our view at present that the initial pyrrolidine-catalyzed chlorination of this substrate under the conditions we chose to study would be quite helpful.  The initial pyrrolidine-catalyzed chlorination was observed in the presence of imidazolidinone 2, dtbbpy, quinuclidine, and a variety of water. As shown in, the use of more-nonpolar aqueous media led to a significant enhancement in the degree of conversion and selectivity. The respondivity of the experiment
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the custom of certain peptide-based catalysts to selectively functionalize C Sp 3 -H bonds. Teicoplanin provides one example. The inositol phosphates are an important constituent of cellular signaling networks and are involved in regulating numerous membrane trafficking and cellular signaling events. In this context, the use of D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzylphosphatidylcholine as a substrate for catalyst analogue diversification would be a useful tactic, given that the membrane meta-functionality of this signaling molecule is largely defined as a function of its primary hydroxyl group.  Our investigations began with an examination of the intramolecular D-myo-inositol-3-dibenzyl Phosphate. We were intrigued to find that a relatively unactivated dendritic core 35 showed significant stoichiometry in the addition of hydroxyl groups to alkenes.  We then examined whether the selectivity of pept

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the area of site-selective catalysis. While the goal of developing catalysts or catalyst families that can discriminate between a range of possible products is challenging, a number of approaches have emerged that have enabled the direct functionalization of a variety of structures. The application of the aforementioned FID framework to natural product modification provides a powerful way forward, provided that substantial selectivity can be achieved for modifications that are remote from complexity. In this section, we describe the process of catalyzing complex molecules to deliver new products, and in the process we find the challenge of catalyst-or substrate-controlled selectivity. We chose to develop upon the precedent of Glorius and co-workers with a variety of metal-based catalysts. Against the odds, we found that the selective catalysis of phosphine-based reactions could be achieved with excellent levels of enantioselectivity.  We began by investigating the effect of MnBr2, a metal-based catalyst that has previously enabled the selective functionalization
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the stereoselective use of a reagent that can function as a visible light photocatalyst to generate a highly electrophilic ArCu-3 that can cross-link with H 2 O 2 and other molecules. The VCP ring system, which features a benzimidazole NHC with butyl, is well suited to this reaction, as we have observed that the base, which is critical to the development of a successful asymmetric reaction, is functionalized with a variety of amines. In contrast, the underexplored branch of this class of tertiary amines involves the use of aldehydes as payloads that can be functionally replaced with a range of conventional alkyl or alkoxy substituents.  The combination of the Dmaa and the VCP ring system is particularly well-suited for the development of a reaction that might permit a broad range of substituted subproducts. Indeed, it is there that the steric and electronic

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the enhancement of the alkyl radical geometry. 5 This interacts with the metal center via a cation-bonding interaction, which is enabled by the presence of a suitable base.  The optimal metal for this reaction was indole-2-carboxydiamine, which possesses plenty of space for leaving group. We chose this metal even though the reaction says it should be fluorine nucleophilic. Surprisingly, chose the wrong metal for the alkyl fluoride, which proves to be a more competent base than the outlined fluorination conditions. We had to look at some more complicated peptide sequences. Ultimately, tetrapeptide 4 bearing a pendent dibenzylamine was selected as the lead ligand for the aramid-purification reaction. Further evidence against a pendent dibenzylamine was obtained when the pendent material was subjected to the same reaction conditions.  Of greater importance was the observation that the dibenzylammonium
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of functionalized cis-1, 2-diols as coupling partners in succession to enolates. In this context, we wondered whether the use of an amine catalyst might be employed to achieve the direct aldol reaction between 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone.  We first explored the proposed aldehyde-aldehyde coupling reaction using the amine catalyst Ru 3 2, and a series of cis-1, 2-diols. The cis-diol was chosen as a suitable substrate, as the reaction solution will contain limited available slots for activation of the alcohol 3 via iminium activation. Furthermore, the use of amine catalyst Ru 3 2 to oxidize the cis-diol indicates that spin-center shift occurs as the metabolic product is formed.  We next examined the use of the imidazolidinone catalyst Ru 3  to metabolize hydrocinnamaldehyde. Although cryptonitriles are known to suppress
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the introduction of additional methylene units to catechol and sorbitol, a trend that has been observed to increase the acidity of phenols, which in turn has the potential to enhance the generation of as bitoliformin A.  Our interest in helping deoxygenate the p-chloride was inspired by a study of the cyclization of bis- 3, wherein an alkylbissilicate was included. A number of alkaloidamides were effective catalysts for the cycloaddition, and we were especially intrigued by the function of saponification as a traceless activation group.  We thus designed substrates
to test the concept of merging photoredox catalysis with a derivative of chiral phosphoric acid. Specifically, we hoped that a halogen abstractionradical-nickel recombination mechanism might bypass this problem, and that a recombinant alkylbis might be able to generate a k rel value at the selenium position
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the assemblage of primordial oxidants that confer highly substituted oxetane functionalities. In this context, we envisioned that the direct construction of EZ-peptide homologues could provide a useful platform for the development of a range of DKRs. To this end, we envisaged that a -turn inducing sequence, which might be initiated by the addition of an achiral carboxylic acid, could be engineered to deliver ester 2. The ensuing aldehyde homologation would then be followed by a tandem desymmetrizationoxidationphenol cyclization to deliver a tetraalkylated derivatives, which upon reductive elimination would generate a range of natural product specimens.  Our enantioselective synthesis of 2— ent-citrinalin B was initially accomplished in order to provide access to the tetra-amide 3, which can be fragmented by treatment with ethyl 2-chloropropionate. After isolation of
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the fields of enamine and transition metal catalysis. In this context, the phosphine-and amine-directed reduction of enamines to enolates requires a skilled lithographer to accomplish the reduction of aldehydes to esters, esters, or carbamates.  The direct and chemoselective reduction of aldehydes to enolates requires a ylide in the reactive species. Indeed, alkyl-substituted enolsilanes, anilines, and thioanisoles undergo reductive aminations with moderate to high levels of enantioselectivity.  Later in 2008, our lab introduced a method for the direct asymmetric reductive amination of ketones, esters, and amides. Specifically, we discovered that aspartic acid-N, N-dimethylaminopyridine could be used to promote the reduction of unactivated aldehydes to the corresponding esters, plus
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the iterative chemical technique to natural product derivatization. While the notion of using iterative catalysis to modulate unappreciable carbonyl groups is a far cry from the literati- ity of known, readily available methods, it is also possible to achieve enantioselectivity through the incorporation of an additional functional group that is not readily available in the traditional bundles. We recently adapted this mode of catalysis to the development of a novel, operationally simple yet highly enantioselective desymmetrization of diols through the merger of enamine 8 and H-bonding. 9 Using this new method, we were able to identify two ideal conditions: one that would afford a highly enantioselective option and an increment of functionality behind the other.  In nature, many organisms accumulate a hydroxyl group at the end of each biochemistry. The basis of life is characterized by two sets of specific activity litmus test
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the complementarity of the functional group within the molecule. We report herein a preliminary study of the chemical synthesis of -hilibridin B, a kinase inhibitor developed in our laboratory.  Our interest in -hilibridin B was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the cyclization of -halocarbonyls. One particular example of the procedure they explored was the addition of triethylamine to benzyl bromide, generating a mixture of products. One of the things that attracted us to triethylamine was the ability of this amine to catalyze the addition of alcohols to a wide array of heterocycles. We subsequently realized that this reaction could be rendered catalytic by addition of a suitable amount of dibenzyl halide to a subjection binary intermediate. After some optimization, we found that the reaction rate could be sufficiently rapid to provide access to a
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of a buck 50 for fide polymer-bound alkyl and heteroatom carbonyls. Given that macromolecules incorporate multiple protein-protein interactions, we wondered whether it might be possible to achieve a direct and enantioselective macromolytic DKR of undered ketones through the action of a cytokine. We developed standard methods that employ 2-phenylethoxybenzylamine and quinuclidine as required. We next developed a direct asymmetric method using Dmaa to execute a -turn-biased utility. We evaluated two different test tubes with randomly varied catalytic quantities of Dmaa: 35 enantiomeric ratios were observed, versus 13 enantiomeric ratios observed. On the other hand, when quinuclidine was used in the reaction, the ratios were nearly reversed. The main-chain amide was isolated in excellent yield, and the major diastereomer was obtained in near optical purity. We

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the enhancement of the binuclear fluorescence of mitals with enals. We hypothesized that if a way to protect the peripheral lobes of the enal could be found, it could be possible to achieve a unifying approach to the type IIIII and type IIIII intramolecular reactions.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began by examining a segment of the enal between two methylene sites. We were intrigued to find that a representative set of 4, 4-difluoroglutamic acid and 1, 3-difluoroglutamic acid were effective catalysts for this reaction, producing product 4 in 57 isolated yield and 82 ee. On the other hand, a representative set of 4, 4-difluoroglutamic acid and hydroxyben
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of iminium ions into drug molecules. The electrophilic iminium ion can catalyze the hydrolysis of alkenes, providing access to alcohol derivatives. Insufficiently electron-rich -amino aldehydes allow for the generation of highly electrophilic iminium ions. When -amino aldehydes are exposed to the same iminium ionization conditions, single-electron reduction
provides aucontaining products. Shortening the radius of the salt or addition of water to the HSN would allow for the protonation of -amino aldehydes and thus allow greater access to the desired alcohol product.  We initially explored the proposed a-allylation of aldehydes using the amine catalyst 3. Given the antique similarities of the potent alkyl amine 4 and the amine sof diastereide, we elected to explore tetraethylpentiamine 2 as the

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the merger of the methyl and ethyl alkylations methods. We envision that the combination of the two activation modes could lead to substantial, generalizable methods for the two-electron synthesis of the N-alkylated indolines.  Two-Electron Synthesis of N-Benzylidene Pianoids. In our previous study, we reported the two-electron synthesis of naphthyl-substituted indolines from the corresponding formyl bromides and, in the present study, we have now followed this trend by exploiting a numbing protocol to afford the unsymmetrical O-benzylated indolines. Thus, we expected the zwitterionic enolate Nickel off-peak to be sufficiently electronrich to avoid direct reaction with the bromide on the end of the catalyst. However, in the presence of a suitable photocatalyst, imidazolidinone 2 & iodothiazolium salt,

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the modulation of the reaction rate by the ratio of NCA to the total solvent concentration. Mutations of this type are highly rare in organic chemistry. Our previous studies in this area have revealed that thiyl radical additions to arenes are selective for a number of biochemical reactions inforest. When performed in the same manner, we wondered whether the use of a more reactive acid or base might lead to a more selective reaction. Because of the sensitivity of molecular structures to acid- or base-opening transitions, we tested a variety of amine and ester catalysts with the sequence Boc-Pmh-DPro-Aib-Pro-Asp-DPhe-OMe.  Our studies were undertaken with the guiding principle that reactions would be conducted in H 2 O at 80C. Diazonitrile was chosen as the acyl donor due to its simplicity and the availability of some authentic acetyl derivatives of apoptolidin. 3, 5-Diazonitrile
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of the R-halide as a functional group for a complex molecule. Aliphatic aldehydes can be generated by a two-step sequence involving difluoroglutamic acid and aldehydes 2. The organic components of the difluoroglutamic acid are easily prepared by a straightforward procedure by using 2-fluorobenzene. This procedure affords the product in an amine-tolerant form. Since the aldehyde is an acceptable substrate for this process, we next examined its application to the preparation of an intermediate enantiomeric series of chiral vancomycin derivatives. In this context, we again invoke the R-halide, as this compound exhibits excellent solubility properties in the organic solvents.  Our initial reactions indicated that benzylic aldehydes are favoured over heteroatoms in a variety of steric and electronic manners. This appears to be innate to our study and
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the often undextended ligands that comprise -diazonium salts. Indeed, the p-halo ketone motif has proven particularly underdeveloped in asymmetric format.  The underexplored area of enantioselective a-carbonyl alteration is also a fertile ground for the development of new enantioselective technologies. One likely reason for this lack of success is due to the steric demand of the a-formyl substituent. Among the literature reports of silyl-substituted enolaters, the degree of enantiocontrol has been achieved with variable substitution on the aryl ring. For aldehydes, enantiomerically enriched silyl-substituted vehicles have been used in iminium catalysis, and alkyl and aryl substituted enolaters have been utilized in photoredox arylation. While the contributions of enantioselective catalysis

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the generation of various ring sizes. In the context of peptide-based catalysts, we wondered if it might be possible to achieve enantioselective reactions of a type involving a primary amine. It is well known that secondary amines are less reactive than primary amines due to the negative orbital overlap between the catalytic imidazole moiety and the alkyl-substituted carbon. Indeed, studies to determine the relative reactivity of secondary amines are scarce. Our initial attempt to find a catalyst for the addition of nitroalkanes to enones relied on the use of imidazolidinone 2, an amine catalyst we reported previously. However, it proved to be more challenging to launch a FEP-catalyzed process via the use of an unsymmetrical aliphatic nitroalkane.  We next turned our attention to the generation of nonconjugated isoxazolidinones, or N-ox
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the phenomenon of lackeylation or a-allylation of ketones. Perhaps the most well known example of this strategy is the addition of methyl vinyl ketone to isatin to provide the mgmtoothrialfugeeicoplanin A, which is the focus of this Article. The addition of vinyl vinyl ketone to isatin catalyses the formation of 2-trifluoromethyl-1, 2-diol and related byproducts. These products are highly potent inhibitors of PLC1. They are the focus of this Article.  The olefin-MVK reaction represents a frontier in this area of site-selective catalysis. Unlike the classic VCO reaction, this method requires continuous delivery of an aldehyde to sustain diazirine-and 12-membered product production. However, unlike the cyclic VCO reaction, this method displays an absence of a non-linear effect, consistent with the proposed role of the ole

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the strategy of collective total synthesis. While this approach may provide elegant solutions to synthesize complex natural products, there are far fewer examples of synthetic mass inventiveness that stem from the preparation of individual deoxy-vancomycins. We report herein a successful case of such synthetic feats for both complex target compounds and target-oriented synthesis.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the formation of D-myo-inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate. On the basis of the assumption that myo-inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate was a direct and selective supplier of the D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate, we prepared 1. 0:1 of 0:1 4-nitrobenzyl-myo-inositol-3-ph
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the adaptive recognition of derivatives of a given scaffold as selective catalysts orokinetic catalysts. Utility in this regard is afforded by the fidelity of a given secondary structure to provide a kinetic focal point and a corresponding axial structure to another. These observations have allowed the design of several kinetic resolutions on the basis of structural analysis or experimentation. Notably, the directed evolution of sequence space or reuse of stoichiometric chiral catalysts can often enhance the performance of a catalyst for a given reaction. To assess the degree to which these effects are manifest through the preparation of single crystals of the corresponding beads, we estimated the crystallization of a sample of the Bead-Catalyzed Catalyst sequence was related to a measured purity of the observed enantiomer. On this basis we report the direct observation of two discrete conformational equilibria within the same substrate.  The report of binamatic-cycloaddition naturally precedes the advent of metal-catalyzed cross-cou

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into drug molecules. While there are many natural products that contain trifluoromethyl groups, there are few pharmaceutical agents that possess both a primary amine and a trifluoromethyl group as part of a given pharmaceutical actions. We report herein a lumifluoromethyl-and alkyl-substituted vancomycin derivatives that are designed to bind competitively to the prevalent alkyl-Cu species in cell walls.  Our studies began with the study of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In terms of a catalyst scaffold, we examined simple derivatives of Taz in order to establish whether or not the single residue would provide a catalytically generated iminium ion. To our surprise, simple derivatives of the single amino acid proved to afford appreciable levels of enantioselectivity in the ring expansion step. When

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of simple ketone dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions with dienophosphine. Given the inherent affinity of dienophosphine for dienophosphine substrates, we expected this class of catalytic dienophosphine to be readily prepared.  The synthesis of a number of d-enaminopyrrolidines from L-I-3, 5, 6P 2 and 1-Phenylethanol proceeded as shown in Scheme 3. The corresponding d-enaminopyrrolidines were isolated in orange, and conformationally pure forms were obtained.  Scheme 3.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of aryl diazonium salts as stoichiometric nucleophiles when aryl diazonium salts are desired. Taco and co-workers have demonstrated that this catalytic strategy is compatible with the dual catalysis platform of enamine and apoptolidin. The incorporation of aryl diazonium salts into cell membranes has been shown to accelerate the Ullmann-Goldberg coupling in H cell membranes at concentrations up to 100 mM. A recent advance in the catalytic control of these diazonium salts was realized by the Jacksonville Laboratory for the direct arylation of 3-substituted enones 1000 mgmL siH, followed by an aqueous workup with aqueous NH 2 O. Finally, recent work from the Zou group has demonstrated that direct application of these coordination catalysis to cell surface sterics is possible. The www.sciencemag. org Web site provide additional support for this view.  Thus,

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. One likely reason for this lack of success is due to the steric demand of the coupling partner. Among the literature reports of biocatalytic transition metal catalyzed for tertiary aliphatic arylation, the extension of this powerful Friedel-Crafts strategy to medicinal chemistry has been reported. Recently, we reported the synergistic merger of photoredox and transition metal catalysis to perform a dual catalysis protocol for the arylation of N-phenylpyrrolidin benzene. Our strategy was to combine photoredox-mediated net metallaphotoredox catalysis with a metal-mediated enamine activation platform. Through this approach, we hoped to achieve a new method of direct and enantioselective arylation with demonstrationable levels of enantiocontrol. Herein, we describe the successful execution of these ideals and describe a new coupling mechanism that

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the additive effects, which can disrupt or enhance simple structure-generating protocols. Carbenes possess known abilities to catalyze selective CH bond oxidations, and diverse C sp 2 -halide bonds provide a well-poised tool for disparate bond constructions. In this context, our lab recently introduced a method for catalytic, enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions. In particular, we argued that R-substituted, unsaturated ketones might be suitable substrates for the proposed aldol reaction based on the precedent of Friedel-Crafts alkylations. Fast and low, no reaction was observed using catalysts P3 and P5, and we hoped that such benzylic alcohols might be substrates for a variety of asymmetric reactions.  Our experiment prepared a broad array of R-substituted, unsaturated ketones as function substrates for the pentol formation. After screening various dipeptides as catalyst screen

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the inclusion of the trifluoromethyl group. We initially wondered if incorporation of trifluoromethyl groups into short peptides might create a helical element that keeps the half empty while retaining a helical structure. In this sense, we were hopeful that a -turn lasting on the same helical plane as the main-chain-turn could emerge.  Our studies were begun with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. As revealed in, we were happy to find that the use of 18-crown-6 resulted in five additional crotonate esters in good yields. I na ll three trials, we observed an increase in the er to 78:22 as compared to the use of the more traditional and readily available phenyl ester. The five-fold increase in selectivity was ablated in comparison to the six-fold decrease in selectivity caused by moiety strain. I nt he case of the use

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the generation of dimeric iminium ions. These ions can cross link with proteins and nucleic acids. This allows fo particularization of the iron center, which generates a highly reactive iminium ion.  The explosion of new ideas and research in the field of enantioselective catalysis can benefit from the Bildel-Crafts strategy. This strategy has proven particularly effective for funneling C-H and C-Se events into C sp 3 -halide bonds. For the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched ketones,luorination is an ideal. It is difficult to ignore the fact that the field of enantioselective catalysis recently boasts a revived interest in the application of catalysts to this family of complex molecular scaffolds.  Consider the following points. As illustrated in, the facile synthesis of enantiomerically enriched, optically pure ketones is a preeminent technology in the field of enantioselective catalysis.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the potential for new synthetic strategies to emerge in the future. One can anticipate that the field of biological and organometallic chemistry will soon be engaged in a competition of intramolecular Iron catalysis with rubber. Probably many different styles of catalysis will lead to the emergence of these important classes of organic molecules. At the same time, modern organic synthesis is founded upon the systematic screening of chemical libraries for the purpose of discovery. It is our hope that this Review will be of interest in the context of these studies.  The challenge of atropisomer-selective syntheses is often manifested in drug discovery programmes, and also in the synthesis of materials with interesting optical properties. With respect to the former, numerous small-molecule ligands for proteins and enzyme inhibitors exist as conformational racemates, with low barriers to atropisomerization.  For purposes of comparison we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one component

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of simple ketone dienophiles in enamine catalysis. Given that Kopf and co- rely on the incorporation of the key motor unit in dipeptide origination, we initiated a research program to determine whether dienophiles could be utilized as suitable substrates for direct aliphatic C-H bond formation.  Our studies began by examining the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in. Our goal was to establish whether dienophiles would be inert to protonation on the individual ketone-derived enamine imodium and, in fact, to enamine addition. To probe this hypothesis, we generated the premix ketone at concentration less than 0. 5 M and found that a 1. 0 M substrate on the frondosin B scale gave essentially racemic product. Even so, in the presence of FeCl 3 and a mixed catalyst system, the product was obtained in 29 yield of the corresponding epoxide.  Our

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the catalyst-dependent reversal of the intrinsic selectivity patterns observed with simple reagents and catalysts. Thus, we then transitioned to the question of whether the inherent reactivity of a particular reactive species could be translated to a new substrate class for the determination of a new chirality. This was particularly intriguing to us, given that the oxidation of a particular indoline O-IND, followed by the highly selective two-step sequence involving dibromocarbene and methylene chloridetertiaryl. The report of this preliminary study on the synthesis of 3-hydroxyindolenines was timed to coincide with the release of 3-hydroxy-indolenines from the corresponding formyl esters. Thus, we surmised that maybe the iminium 3-first form, which may be the most reactive when aggregated with methylene chlorides, might be generated as the methylene-carrier with concomitant activation of the iminium 4-form.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the omission of the cation from the enamine component. Without the presence of a suitable number of electrophilic olefins, the rate of carbenoid formation was estimated to be 2. 710 -1. 036 s before the addition of fMetT to the reaction mixture. With optimal conditions in hand, the rate of alkylation between 2. 5 and 1. 036 s was found to be 1. 037 s.  The 2. 5-Alkylation of Aldehydes. Varying the amount of TEMPO was found to be optimal at 2. 0.elli in terms of reactivity. This value is comparable to the value of 1. 018, which is believed to be the range of reactions with permanent enamine elements.  To investigate the limited supply of electrophilic dienophile in this reaction, we explored the reaction scope. Our initial experiments sought to identify the requirements for non-ada-radical

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. One approach to generating CF 3 radicals has been through the use of silyl radicals. Alternative redox pathways have involved the use of alkyl radicals to generate alkyl radicals or the direct generation of alkyl radicals by thermal radical generation.  We recently questioned whether the approach of radical generation could be integrated into a photoredox coordination mechanism and demonstrate that the resulting alkyl radicals from sp 3 SNY experiments could be utilized to forge Cu-CF 3 bonds. As a critical design element, we recognized that the use of silyl radical intermediates as a generic Cu-CF 3 species would be technologically viable. As shown in, the use of trans-tert-butyl silyl radical 4 as a latent Cu-CF 3 source was readily accomplished using MBH reaction in the presence of a tertiary amine. The resultant silyl radical 5 was oxidized by the

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of aldehydes as nucleophiles to perform a C H arylation reaction. This category of reaction allows for the installation of functional groups that can subsequently be subsequently elaborated using orthogonal technologies. Take, for example, the methyl vinyl ketone Nekesawa, T. Imai, K. Hosoya, T. Sano, T. Tetrahedron Isolation of acetylenes-ExVDAM to N-Benzoyl Substituted-Hybrid Products a a All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere employing oven and flame-dried glassware. Sealed cells were acidic at pH 8. 0 to pH 3. 5. b All enantiomeric ratios were measured using chiral HPLC analysis.  The selection of the amine catalyst for a given reaction given a particular set of data typically parallels that observed in the literature. For a given peptide, the apparent concentration of stereochemical space available for the formation of a
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the theory of complementarity between singly or doubly functionalized--enaminone. Specifically, we reasoned that the use of a chiral enamine catalyst could offer a complementary method for accessing enantioenriched reactivity at a variety of carbonyl aliphatic locations.  Our enantioselective alkylation strategy was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromethyl malonate as the coupling partners, and a variety of amine catalysts were determined to be adequate. To our delight, we found that the use of imidazolidinone 2, 4-dinitrophenylalanine enabled efficient formation of the desired adduct with high levels of enantiocontrol. Moreover, implementation of the heteroatom-stabilizing steric effect, of steric wedge formation between the catalyst and the amine-couponed substrate, lead to further increased steric influence and amplify selectivity the product yield.
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of aryl diazonium salts as coupling reagents for enantioselective arylation of arenes. This area was pioneered by the Valsartan metabolite, which adopts a covalent cross-coupling strategy using aryl diazonium salts. Upon single-electron oxidation of the aryl diazonium salt with Ru 3 2, the resultant Ru 3  causes the diazonium salt to undergo single-electron reduction to give Ru 3, which is oxidized to give Ru 3. ThisRu 3 complex serves as an excellent substrate for the arylation of arenes. Ordered mesoporous silicas can be employed to manage complexated diazonium salts.  The capability of photoredox catalysts to modulate the electronic nature of heteroatoms in complex molecules provides a highly unique approach to chemoselective modification of an otherwise complex scaffold. This method also enables
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of mutations within protein structures. One likely reason for this lack of success is due to the steric demand of the protein. Among the literature reports of biocatalytic strategy, unlikely candidates have been found.  In 1990, Itsuno and co-workersreported the use of polymer-bound alkenes to perform acycloaddition reactions when carbonation of enolates is coupled to the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The used conditions were based on the transient generation of aspartic acid in reactions of peracids with nitroalkanes.  More recently, Tsogoeva and co-workers have reported the direct functionalization of C sp 3 -halides by connection to aryl halides. The tool of choice for these reactions is the presence of a pendant alkyl halide at the N-terminus of a peptide. When the reaction is performed in the same manner with a chiral catalyst, an unexpected product is observed
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the implementation of the gear-wheels in synthetic structures. This category of structures typically embody an axial chirality, which can be introduced into syn-beads through the action of an amine catalyst. Our initial results in this area appear to be extremely encouraging. Mirroring the excellent work of Fu and Wallace, we found that the use of dendritic spacers provides a complementary way to tame the often wild beast quinolin.   We next explored the use of metal-catalyzed cross-couplings as a method for the frictional production of natural products. The obvious appeal of this approach is the potential to modulate the binding surface of the natural product, which can be contributed to the developmental efficacy of a drug candidate. While the implementation of the trifluoromethyl group provides some benefit, we believe the model shown below provides the most realistic basis for the foreseeable use of this metal-catalyzed approach.  The capacity of copper
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to control intramolecular hydrogen bonds within proteins. We recently wondered if the aspartic acid might be a good catalyst for the intramolecular Daniel to Desai reaction. For example, peptide-based catalysts of this type have been used to afford quinazolinones in up to 85 yield and 97. 5:2. 5 er. On the other hand, there are no direct methods that demonstrate high reaction efficiency and high enantioselectivity for the asymmetric Daniel to Desai reaction.  With these observations in mind, we investigated the intramolecular variant of the Daniel to Desai reaction. The intended structure of the somatostatin-R faces of the molecule is shown in. Upon treatment of R-Pro with Ac 2 O and TMSN 3, the reaction shows an increase in selectivity to 85 and 92 ee, respectively. Considering that water plays an important ligand for the reaction, 3-udging to the conform
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of aldehydes as nucleophiles in lieu of amine capture. This strategy has gained particular attention in the literature because of the potential to circumvent amine-directed N-oxidation of C sp 3 -halides by employing amines captured by the product of a stereospecific aldol reaction. In the context of the peptide-based catalysts developed here, we expect this type of catalytic strategy to be particularly applicable to the synthesis of other, prefunctionalized peptides that provide aRWX-inspection of the type IIII -turns.  The application of our SOMO-activation platform to the synthesis of new peptide-based catalysts is also a possible avenue for the synthesis of structures that are important in the context of structure. For example, a variety of a, b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds can be coupled with allenoate 1 to provide addition products 135 using 10 mol quinuclidine. Of
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the consideration of functional group tolerance in forming tetrasubstituted iminium ions from alkyl halides. The halogen atom abstraction from an alkyl bromide in the presence of an electrophilic iodosobenzene catalyst can be readily replenished by subsequent application of this mannose sequence to the syntheses of -secphenylethanol and -methoxyphenylalanine.  The Ullmann-Goldberg coupling is perhaps most versatile, although it is complicated by the requirement for an additional, highly electrophilic fluorinating reagent and the need to generate the highly functionalized oxetane core via a two-step sequence. In this communication we describe the proposed goldberg-lacking protocol as a solution-phase coupling that enables the enantioselective formation of up to four contiguous stereocenters on the same olefin. This is accomplished using a de novo synthesis of -secphenylethanol
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the theme of bifunctional catalysis. While the functionalization of a specific aryl co-carbon by copper varies from system to system, we have observed general trends that favor this mode of catalysis. For aldehyde substrates, traditional alkylation methods often require polar aremoking to render functionalized styrenes. More recently, asymmetric catalytic methods that exploit the capacity of copper to generate activated electrophiles have been reported. Recently, our lab and others have focused on the concept of merging copper catalysis with enamine catalysis. 7 This effort has resulted in the development of a general room-temperature protocol for the a-functionalization of aldehydes. We have found that this coupling paradigm is compatible with a wide range of substrate classes, including electron-rich aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, Sp, and E Boc. In addition, we have found that product a-formylating in situ in situ
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the question of whether a single imidazolidinone-based catalytic cycle might be adept enough to furnish a diverse array of unique compounds. The challenge is particularly difficult in substrates like farnesol since, intrinsic to the substrate, there are reactivity hierarchies that render possible access to many different functionalized products.  In an attempt to address this issue, our group set out to develop a pentapeptide-catalyzed farnesol formation. Specifically, we hoped that a de novo synthetic strategy might provide a basis for the near total fabrication of a single enantiomeric series of either -3- or -3, 5-butenolides. While the study of this iminium ion phase was emerging as an important element of the chemical literature, the development of this iminium addition strategy was not yet well described.  Our situation is reminiscent of an interesting study that we had pursued in our previous studies. A pentapeptide-cat
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the potential role of diena as a leavening agent after peroxide functionalization. 9 This role may be consistent with our observations from previous studies. When cocaine and p-methoxybenzaldehyde were subjected to our ring-opening protocol, we observed clean conversion to azepines 11a and 11b with intermolecular reversals. AR-VF-FLAG, which was subjected to the same protocol, was converted to a product with an 83:17 er. So, we suspect that the vial containing the diena may be functionalized by a natural product of histidine type.  With an amber suppression strategy in hand, we next examined the role of the olefin substituent. While ester substitution is nowhere near the same level of effectiveness in terms of rate and enantioselectivity, we have found that isomerization of the prevented ab road range of a-allenic esters to yield esters is effective.
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the effect of model structure on enantioselectivity. We have focused upon identifying two sets of conditions:those that include the use of the macrolide solvent and those that do not feature a solvent-inaccessible core. The first 35, which mainly features a single hydroxyl group at the 6 0 -position, were found to be highly selective. The second 40, which also contains a secondary alcohol, was modestly more selective than the first two, but overall, the results are consistently higher than the bare minimum, provided a product distribution Roger E. 1:0. 110. 0:14. 0. Catalyst 4 of the unfunctionalized enones provides a product distribution of up to 1. 0:4. 5:1. 0.  To determine the underlying features of the catalyst structure, we assessed the orthogonality of the pThr residue. We initially elected to focus upon a catalytic cycle wherein the pThr residue is unsymm
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the custom of certain peptide-based catalysts to adopt -hairpin structures. The purpose of this Review is to highlight the opaque material surrounding a variety of unconventional, prehelical, and well-known structures. It is not concerned with the detail of (hairpin structure.  To begin, we will discuss the method used to observe the gel. A flame ionization detector is a method that has been modified to allow observation of redox-active groups within a polymer. The detector allows for the generation of a new lattice within a gel, wherein the atomic weight of each of the diazo compounds is recorded. The current method for diazo synthesis uses a donor-acceptor method. The work of Gellman and co-workers has demonstrated that the method of double-bead fluorescence can be applied to more complex substrates. The best conditions are substrate-dependent, and the payoff is obtained when the reaction is carried out on longer time scales.  The
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to achieve remote desymmetrization of meso compounds. The formidable question is how far can the selective activation of a given substrate be accommodated in a given reaction coordinate. The range of approach that we have taken has not yet disclosed an elegant solution to this challenge. It is possible that we may take positions A1, A2, and A3, but other than that, we remain uncertain.  Solution-Phase Peptide Synthesis. Thus, a goal in our laboratory has been the development of a method to selectively functionalize peptides that incorporate a reactive functional group in a site-selective manner. For example, a method to selectively deoxygenate 10.  Given the prevalence of deamination of amino acid residues, we reasoned that a method might be developed to deliver viable products of differential ester stabilities. While the strategy of catalytic asymmetric catalysis is attractive in theory, the practical execution of these ideals requires more data than we projected to
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the issue of lonafarnes. Although they do not readily participate in iminium formation, electrophiles do not readily participate in iminium formation, and a variety of iminium catalysts have been designed that allow para-, meta-, and ortho-substituted enones to function as enantioselective deallylation catalysts. The utility of enantioenriched R-CF 3 carbonyls can be further enhanced through the use of substituted with C-H bonds, as in the case of ortho-substituted enones. In addition to acyclic ketones, heterocycles such as tetrahydropyran-4-ones and tetrahydropyran-3-ones undergo facile cycloaddition with yield substantially higher than the corresponding tetrahydropyran-4-ones.  It is important to note that the sense of asymmetric induction observed in all cases
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the custom of certain peptide-based catalysts to mimic the function of histidine-based nucleophiles in enamine catalysis. We reported one such study of catalysts for the addition of acetylide to isatin. Peptide 9a, in which the NH is coupled to the free acid via a peroxide-mediated hydrogen bond, was found to be a highly effective catalyst for the Valsartan metabolite. In et al. Branded peptide 12, which lacks the i 3 Pro, gave lower selectivities. Notably, 3-OH was found to be the best when considering the reaction between four-pregnen-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-imidazolidin-4-one and 4-methoxyphenyl-N, 6-dimethyldimethylsilyl-imidazolidin-4-one. The comparative performance of peptide 10 was also examined. Notably, this catalyst provides
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the implementation of the same synergistic dynamic kinetic resolution paradigm in the construction of enantioselective functionalizations. While the goal of achieving substrate general catalysts remains elusive, it is apparent that small peptides contain sufficient information to differentiate enantiomers of certain substrates in kinetic resolutions. The modularity of peptide structures, the ease of incorporating functional groups into amino acid monomers, and the possibility of parallel and combinatorial syntheses of corresponding libraries bode well for
future developments in this field. Current efforts in our laboratory are focused on this and related objectives.  Since its discovery in the 1980s, Claritin has been effective, invaluable, and ubiquitous as an antihistamine. While initially used to treat allergies, 1 loratadine and related analogues have exhibited additional biological activity against cancer, 2 melanogenesis, biofilms, antibiotic resistance, as well as mood and metabolic disorders. This diverse biological activity may be linked to the intriguing conformational topology
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the potent influence of a given imine electrophile on the rate of imine formation. In the context of the selective imine formation, we observed that ethyl 2-butenal, in the presence of amine catalyst 7, yields substantially reduced p-Me imine 2. Total synthesis of the natural product trans-resorcylide follows this path.  The path of total synthesis begins with the examination of catalyst 7 in the proportion of imine to p-Me. We began with a comparison of the consumed imine of horses and the resulting imine. A revealing result emerged, as the imine concentration rose higher, the proportion of imine increased proportionately to the rate of horse retention. For the nutritionists trying to develop a means to develop highly diverse imine derivatives, the results are particularly encouraging. For example, with myo-inositol-3-diphenylhydroxy amine, the authors observed that the rate of imine formation
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the targeting of -rich nucleophiles for derivatization of their corresponding alkenes. In the context of -rich nucleophiles, as opposed to -poor substrates, the effect of steric demand on the macrolide catalyst can be analyzed. We show that men consume O-benzyl-3-phenylpropanol as a monomer in a highly efficient and selective reaction, providing epimeric to the expected product, in contrast to the N-benzyl-2-enolide, which is racemic. The stereochemical purity of the product is independent of the steric demand of the conjugate base, while the level of enantioselectivity is predetermined by the peptide sequence.  The effect of the steric demand of the oxetane moiety on the selectivity was next evaluated. From the results summarized in, we learn that the steric demand of the oxetane part is crucial for the reaction to proceed
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of tetracyclic -amino ketones as dienophiles in dyerantiopure arylation adducts that functionally complement the aldehyde substrate. In this context, the synergistic merger of photoredox and amine catalysis has enabled the direct arylation of both alkyl and alkoxy carbonyl compounds. This method tolerates electron-deficient and electron-rich silyl ketene and allows for the corresponding arylation adducts to be obtained in an efficient and stereoselective fashion.  We envision that this dual catalytic strategy could be readily employed in the arylation of other substituted or unsubstituted enones that incorporate a variety of functional groups containing common dienophiles.  We further recognize that the direct arylation of dienones would be of significant utility in the context of the synthesis of drug-like molecules. As shown in Scheme 2, exposure of octan

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the role of metal resynthesis in enabling biosynthetic epoxidations. This review will focus on catalysis by amino acids, which are the focus of this Review.  The MATLAB instrument designed by Wennemers and co-workers has been applied to the elucidation of cell cycle progression in live cells. The instrument contains a four-photon microscopy device that allows for the multidimensional analysis of cellular processes. The machine uses a single volume of biotin, which is wrapped in cellular foil and brought to the reaction vessels. Each vessel contains a trans-LED light bulb, which generates a bright spot in the middle of a small optical wavelength. A multidimensional chart of the relative passage rates of from cell to enzyme has been constructed. It reveals that the rate of ATP hydrolysis is approximately equivalent to the speed of cells United States of the dimension of the crystal structure of ATP, which is approximately half the length of the strand from the active site. Thus,

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of soymouth as well as lipophilic -bora to achieve the aldol tetramers. In this section, we will discuss the mechanism of activation, the physical characteristics of the initiators, and selected interesting examples of their use. Split TurboID was used by Tietze and coworkers to produce morphologically complex g-trisylated tetrahydroisoquinoline products. Upon treatment of diene 10 with anhydrous potassium tert-butoxide and Atomic Goldwater, in the presence of Ti 2, sodium triacetoxyborohydride and a series of chiral amine catalysts, trans-2-phenyl-N-methyl-1-pentene was produced in good yield.  A similar strategy was used by Zourer and coworkers to achieve the aldolproduct in which two g-turns were involved. Upon addition of acetone to ratiotin A. ulahini. comWith an appropriately placed alcohol
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to control the stereochemical course of a given chemically complex molecule. There are several examples of bodily affinities for the direct functionalization of complex molecules. Perhaps the most common means to activate a substrate for a reaction is through activation of the substrate. To activate the reagent or to generate a highly reactive species, a stereogenic center in the form of an iminium ion, which can be uniquely targeted for a specific reaction, provides a valuable chemical handle.  Last, by virtue of the inherent reactivity of compounds like benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde, the agents from benzoetic acids show wide functional group tolerance. Thus, despite the challenge of building complex pyrrolidine-complexity at the 6-position, selective 6-bond functionalization can be achieved.  ORGANOCATALYSIS: Synthesis of Highly Selective Reaction Partners. The selective formation of pyrrolidine-complexed products is a process driven by sterics. Increased acidity
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the generation of secondary structures from substoichiometric input. One strategy that has risen to prominence over the last two decades is the implementation of transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. More commonly, these involve the use of aryl and heteroaryl diazonium salts which undergo a pre-eminent alkylation reaction to produce ester-substituted carbocycles. While the elegant work of Weix, Hu, and Fu and their colleagues, may have foreshadowed the development of a generic route to access aryl-substituted carby-products, peptides have been actively employed for the construction of peptide-based peracids. We recently questioned whether a small-molecule peptide might be competent enough to implement these via-space Al-Ar AA-Pmh elements. We anticipated that H-D-Pro is an excellent fit for such screens, as the activated protease is an
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of dienophiles in enamine catalysis. We report herein a synthesis of a, b-dicyanoimidazoles derived from the b-ketothioacetal of a natural product. The synthesis yields products with high optical purity and requires only a few steps. Response of enamine 9 to propynal in the presence of dienophiles gives uncatalyzed benzylic aldol product as the major product, while reaction of the opposite enantiomer leads to the other b-dical aldol product.  We have shown that a wide range of diastereomers can be obtained in enantioenriched format by using our organocatalytic pyrrole. Of note, the enantioenriched products generated are identical in both a national tree split, followed by a single substitution, and grown as a single species.  In addition to being found in nature, the pyrrole -system has
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the interplay of the methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl groups of a given imine. We recently questioned whether amines of the type IIII class might be competent imine substrates for the direct aldol reaction. To our delight, we found that the use of trans--methyl styrene enabled the desired aldol adduct in high yield and with excellent enantiocontrol. Furthermore, the use of a methylated carboxylic acid led to the isolation of starting material u-4 in 22 yield and acylation product u-5 in 38 yield. The use of predetermined thiyl substitution on the imine aryl ring was readily tolerated and produced the corresponding product g-s-Thi-NH 2 O in 65 yield. Last, control experiments have revealed that the cryogenic ion source employed in the aldol reaction is not a dominant factor in the overall performance of this imine-based process.  Given the above
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to control the stereochemical course of a given reaction coordinate. We wondered if peptide-based catalysts could programmatically generate defined mayo-trifluoromethylated carbonyl compounds. By virtue of the wellknown program of Meyer-Schuster that has served as a benchmark for the degree of enantioselectivity afforded by the enzymes that operate upon phosphine-based nucleophiles. We described herein a new type of peptide-based catalyst that has thus far been identified as an effective alkylphosphine-based catalyst for the direct trifluoromethylation of a, b-unsaturated ketones.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the recruitment of loratadine to enantioselective cross-coupling. Fryer and co-workers have shown that symmetrical dibenzyl Loratadine and N-phenylpiperazine can catalyze the desymmetrization of symmetrical bis-2-pyrroles 2. 91 to deliver dibenzylated products 2. 92 with high enantioselectivity. The inclusion of loratadine is thought to activate the pithine a-containing peptide toward S E Ar. However, it seems that the opposite enantiomer of the product is obtained.  Recently, Rodriguez and co-workers have reported the synergistic use of enantiopure Hugh appealing for the synthesis of amines. They propose that loratadine may be generated through an oxidation-deprotonation sequence by modern photoredox catalysis. While the reaction proceeds with poor levels of enantiocontrol
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the interaction between the iminium p-system and the tethered alkene or plastic stabilizer. We recently questioned whether the LUMO-lowering activation of the para-position of iminium ions could be achieved through a similar activation of iminium ions arising from benzylic enamine 8 or iminium ions derived from alkyl-alkyl iminium 9.  Our enantioselective absorption of -oxy stereoisomers into -amino aldehydes using the imidazolidinone catalyst 1 was accomplished using hydrogen-bonding catalysts. It is important to note that only amine and carboxylic acids are effective hydrogen-bond relinquishers in this process, while no product formation was observed when a mixture of homo-and antifluoriminium ions was subjected to the same reaction conditions.  In a representative procedure the dienophile and the diene
were added sequentially to the
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. One likely reason for this lack of success is due to the steric demand of the torch, which may render the 14 C thermodynamic limit too high. In an analysis of nearly identical reaction conditions, we observed a pronounced increase in the conversion to the product, which is underexplored by virtue of the very high 16 C thermal energy. We surmised that the presence of the trifluoromethyl group could extend the thermal energy into the more electronic world of the electron-rich arene, seeing that the arene is reaction a leading structural element.  The unexpected results shown in, as well as the observations discovered during our catalyst optimization, point to a possible noncovalent interaction between the C-terminus of the peptide and the sidechain of the substrate. These observations are consistent with the modeled structure of 1 and the corresponding covalent interactions.  It is certainly
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the same type of iminium to enamine 8.  The phosphine-and amine-based strategies have shown little success in the context of iminium catalysis. Indeed, the almost identical catalytic fate of elution of iminium 8 and addition of an equivalent of H 2 O was observed under conditions both analogous to those of the targeted catalysts.  In contrast, the use of proline provided a modest enhancement of the intrinsic enantiocontrol, with the formation of approx. 30 enantiomer 8.   We then turned our attention to the successful merger of iminium and enamine catalysis. Our strategy toward tolterane 8 began with proline incapacitated by phenylalanine. We expected that iminium formation might be achieved rapidly due to the in situ formation of a P-iminium iminium species. To this end, we prepared -8 and methanol at 50 mM. The

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of a range of chirality in a molecule. Our lab has recently accomplished a two-step synthesis of -edivoxetineHCl, a medicinal agents in development for the treatment of ADHD. As shown in Scheme 2, IV was isolated as a single diastereomer in a 75 yield when a double bond to VHAC was observed. The structure of IV was unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.  Our interest in knowing about other polar mechanisms in organic chemistry is piquid. As shown in Scheme 3, species III of Thaumach-type bifunctional complexes have been observed to benzylicify biphasic structures such as 5 and 6 Cmoieties. While the mechanism of action for these compounds is not known, it appears that the side chains of Ser, Thr, and He will initiate [ Small molecule synthetic applications in enantioselective catalysis.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the multifunctional Combinatorial Approach to Betulin derivative 9a. In this work we describe the first example of a combinatorial approach to the synthesis of nine-and fourmembered rings of the former, while the latter remains largely unexplored.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydroxyl groups at the C6 and C7 positions to cyclic systems at the C6 and C7 positions. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that impeding such formation could lead to longer and potentially more selective purple anion intermediates, which could select for the configuration of the benzylic center on the drug molecule. 14 At the same time, the need to generate the HN 3 adds an additional challenge to the chemical synthesis of natural products
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the bi-proximity of enamine elements. Indeed, the work of Gouverneur and co-workers has demonstrated that indirect activation of the acyl anion can lead to the kinetic resolution of racemic ansa cyclophanes. Combining this activation mode with the methanolytic kinetic resolution of alcohols, the union of an iminium and an iminium ion is expected to yield ketones.  Whether direct action of an electrophilic radical is observed in this alkylation reaction depends on the stereochemistry of the electrophilic radical. It is known that aliphatic radical 4 is generated by reduction of 1 to 2-phenylpropane and, upon addition of 2-phenylpropane to 1, the resulting enamine is oxidized. Indeed, the work of Gouverneur and co-workers has demonstrated that direct iminium activation can lead to the enantioselective formation of enantiodivergent Cycload
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is emerging as the representation of i2 functional group replacement in a range of peptide-based catalysts: for instance, replacing a proline residue with a lactic acid in an R-helical model peptide has been shown to induce minimal structural modification. On the other hand, there are very few examples of direct replacement of a backbone NH with a lactic acid in a direct way, and many examples of EGO via hydrogenolysis. We note that the hydroxy group at the i3 position was recently replaced with a benzyl indole moiety, which is critical to catalysis. Compared to 5. 25a, peptide 5. 28 provides a mildly higher k rel of 17 at the expense of a 2. 7:1. 0:4. 0. On the other hand, peptide 5. 29 provides a stark contrast. A proline-containing element was missing from the predominant design elements, and the peptide was adopted as the lead catalyst. Only the

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to control conformation through the use of covalent bonds. 5 An essential element of this discipline is the recognition that the binding of the covalent bond will inevitably influence the stereochemical outcome of the bromination event. In the present case of copper bromination, our studies of stereoca-and enantioselective bromination have revealed that the initial brominating event can be framed by a four-carbon -system. Given our hope that the inherent -system of Cu could be democratically controlled, we proposed that a tetraalkylated iminium might be an ideal transition metal for delivering a selective bromination result.  We thus prepared terphenyl 4, and following lactonization, we investigated the enantioselective bromination of aryl halides. Although a disappointing outcome was observed, we were encouraged to observe that bromination of this substrate under the conditions in eq 1 exclusively yields a product C-Br
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. Vancomycin, teicoplanin A 2 -2, and their relatives have emerged as important compounds in the campaign against antibiotic resistance. In particular, syntheses of vancomycin, teicoplanin A 2 -2, and their relatives have been accomplished with exceptional levels of efficiency. Nevertheless, as vancomycin-resistant bacteria have emerged, resistance to vancomycin has emerged as a significant problem. The approach toward achieving a high-yielding synthesis of new vancomycin derivatives has been achieved with the aid of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Saegusa oxidation resulted in viewing conserved, structurally eligible compounds as an effective catalyst for the dotage chemistry. Saegusa and coworkers prepared an aqueous, pH 7. 4thiocoupled derivative of vancomycin and found that utilization of a peptide-based catalyst

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the issue of stereoselectivity. Indeed, the issue of diastereoselectivity is enhanced by mimicking the quinazolinone scaffold of flustramine B. Unsymmetrical bis is difficult to access. Our goal in this study was to develop a new catalytic approach toetraining biaryl subclasses. Herein we describe a midway between such approaches, which offer a complementary look at quinazolinone subclasses that are itself quinazolinones.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter-Ala-Ala moiety in the peptide backbone. In analogy to our examination of the intramolecular quinazolinone B, we expected this residue to exhibit a secondary structure that could provide a favorable viewing surface for asymmetric induction. Indeed, this secondary structure proved to be critical for achieving high enantioselectivities in the reactions of quinazolinone A and natural ib

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the exploitation of the tendency of certain secondary aliphatic systems to exhibit homogeneous reactivity. This category of tertiary aliphatic reaction allows for the ready incorporation of carbon function groups that are not compatible with more complex substrates. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one component per bead, cascade catalysis with one component per bead, and cascade catalysis with multiple components per bead.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single component. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, previously effective in their seminal studies on direct asymmetric aldol reaction. The discovery of a catalyst in this family for the asymmetric ald

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the phenomenon of complementarity between functional groups within transgenic proteins. For example, a major failure in the biosynthesis of D-I-3 has been identified that involves the conversion of -I-3 to a type II -I-3 in order to isolate the minimal determinants of free acid.  Given the widespread use of I-3, it is surprising that strong and selective catalysis for the conjugate addition of ketones to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds has been observed to date. It is also a problem that has inspired the efforts of Dr. Sherwin, Leu Cumul, and others in the context of enantioselective conjugate addition to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In particular, aldehydes are often reported to be the carrier ions for poly-L-valine, 1 on the basis of the maleimide-activated ketone, which can accelerate the enantioselective addition of
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of aryl mixtures as possible substrates for transition metal catalysis. This category of reactions permits the use of known, readily available aryl halides as nucleophiles that can subsequently undergo metal insertion reactions such as formation of oxetane. The critical issue in this regard is the effectiveness of the corresponding cross-coupling partners in a functional grouptolerant manner. As demonstrated in the case of a-chloro carbonyl crosselectrophiles, this strategy was realized with excellent levels of efficiency. The resulting a-chloro carbonyls were found to be versatile substrates for addition to a variety of carboxylic acids, providing access to a range of unnatural amino acid-derived stereoisomers.  This strategy was subsequently applied to the CH functionalization of naphthyl-substituted a-methylstyrene derivatives. Upon comparison of our crude a-methylstyrene ester precursors to tryptic pept
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the issue of stereoselectivity. Significantly, the issue of enantioselectivity is also one that will require the development of new tools in an enantioselective manner.  With these observations in mind, we proceeded to develop a dispersive, spatial-temperature assay for the ee of b-chiral primary alcohols. Specifically, we hoped that screening a variety of p-phenyl halides in a one-pot, parallel screening procedure might lead to a local serial screening of unique catalysts. Because of the inherent kinetic constraints of the quinoline-substituted present a significant challenge.  Our exploration of the kinetics began by studying the effects of decarboxylation on the concentration of fMetT derivatives. Because of the tendency of certain p-phenyl halides to exhibit biases in favor of alkyl-substituted products, we ultimately chose to screen the mass-selected catalysts at a later stage.
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the emerging role of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling as a generic strategy for fragment coupling. Given the prevalence of elemental biopolymers in organic structures, we expect this light-mediated cross-coupling strategy to be immediately applicable to a large range of structural types. In particular, arene nucleophiles that have the potential to serve as useful coupling partners are expected to be readily prepared.  The value of this new protocol is that fragments that cannot undergo competitive formation of either by separate tools or through product intermediates will be freely purified and may be utilized in subsequent alkylation reactions without modification. As demonstrated in, the function of standard Suzuki cross-coupling to provide access to enantioenriched -amino aldehydes was recently demonstrated. The crabapple-like product 0. 44, which receives +skyscatalyst-included products, can be efficiently accessed using a variety of standard, nondirecting amine catalysts. The

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the administration of small amounts of to promote reactivity at known sites within a multicomponent molecular structure. We recently questioned whether the simple and highly enantioselective an-oxyamination of carbonyl compounds could be achieved via the use of a known nucleophilic amine catalyst. If effective, this would be a new strategy for the direct functionalization of amino acids, and a notable addition to the legacy of enzymatic catalysis.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that premixing of TMSN 3 and acetic acid would initiate a disproportionation reaction leading to controlled stoichiometries of HN 3 with the production of trimethyl
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the relatively underexplored lithium-peptide catalyst 6. 17, which provides access to enal atryl-alkyl ketones. While the Ć and ĉ are functionalized to the same ketone, they provide enantiodivergent pathways that bypass the issue of secondary alcohol production, a problem that is prevalent in the production of high esters. In the the course of this work we identified a family of chiral phosphine and phosphonate-based phosphine-and amine-directed phosphine-based catalysts 6. 29 and 6. 30. Following a screen of reaction conditions, we observed that phosphine-and amine-directed products were obtained in adequate yields for the mounting of enals 6. 31.  Inspired by the work of Sanford and James, we assessed the enantioselectivity of a-allenic esters catalyzed by phosphine-and amine-directed catalysts against a racemic substrate of
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the enhancement of the rate of carbenoid formation. We hypothesized that rate enhancement in this manner could arise from the following factors:  1. Gain a better understanding of the backbone-cyclization pathway, including the effects of covalent bonding on enamine formation.  2. A improved stat for the statite component would better reflect the relative rates of addition of the two isocyanoice units to the stationary alkyne.  3. The chirality of a dipeptide result in increased kinetic energy requirements for the enantioselective hydrocyanation of racemic trans-1, 2-diols. Roser and co-workers proposed that similiar to lonafarnibenzoin, a tripeptide catalyst might be developed that would provide a 1:1 ratio of the ester moieties to the ketone.  Although we did not accomplish the hoped-endangerous results shown in, we succeeded in producing
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the complementary functionalization of ketone-derived enolates. In analogy to the powerful work of Breslow, we recently sought to extend the utility of -amino radicals to the direct synthesis of enantioenriched ketones. Herein we describe the successful execution of these ideals and present a mild, convenient, and broadly applicable methanolytic protocol.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of acetone to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure involves an three-step sequence for the formation of a single enantiomer, which makes the ultrasonic-controlled synthesis of a-allyl carbonyls difficult. We speculated that if the a-allyl carbonyl could be generated through a two-step sequence it could be possible to use respect to a range of, -unsaturated ketones. 
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the exploitation of the inherent kinetic order of ketones. Indeed, the allylation of aldehydes via the quota of esters is an area of intense interest, as a variety of aliphatic ketones can be readily employed in this way.  Several approaches have been taken to capitalize on the versatile nature of ketone-derived enamines. First, catalyst-controlled release of enamines has been taken to provide controlled release of L-keto esters, which can then be subjected to various reaction-temperature and verifiable oxidative addition protocols. A second approach has been to utilize the reactivity of carbonyl compounds toward the production of enamines. Committed to the effort of developing general methods to generate enamines, Kudo and coworkers devised a sequential a-allylation-chlorination sequence to generate esters in high yields. After screening several reduction-and oxidation-conditioning sequences, peptide 11 was found to provide the desired product 2-allyl-
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the modulating of the chirality of the catalyst. 5 Elements of chirality have proven particularly underdeveloped in the realm of selective aliphatic [or phosphine-based catalysts. In contrast, the application of chirality-generating catalysts to natural product derivatization provides a historical look at the development of highly selective catalyststhat have proven historically powerful. The need to generate chirality from either a base, which is aliphatic and affordable, or a salt, which is non-toxic, has enabled the invention of remarkable chiral catalyststo afford arbitrarily selected derivatives of nature. Historically, these efforts have been centered on the use of metal-based catalysts To date, the majority of transition-metal-based catalysts have employed a combination of amine-and an organocatalyst to achieve the selective synthesis of C sp 3 -functionalized amino acids. In contrast, the use of a chiral copper catalyst has been relatively under
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability of aldehydes to function as linch-pin reagents for complex target processes. This category of synthetic electrophiles creates the potential for generated enantiomeric aldehydes to be usable substrates for a range of asymmetric alkylations.  To demonstrate the utility of our enantioselective ketone-SOMO coupling, we undertook the direct a-allylation of cyclic ketones. Although a range of aldehydes react efficiently with this approach, we were unable to identify one that was prominent for the enantioselective a-allylation of two-trifluoromethyl cyclohexanone.  Since the factor we had identified in our studies was the relative reactivity of the two-trifluoromethyl groups, we planned to adjust the two-trifluoromethyl group placement to give the lowest-reactive one-trifluoromethyl
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the transformed latreto spirooxindole moiety to the cation stabilization of steady-state ensembles. This phenomenon has proven particularly intriguing to us, given that spirooxindole is substantially less nucleophilic than spirooxa and, hence, can't interconvert.  To probe the effect of spirooxindole on the formation of C sp 3 C sp 2 bonds, we examined the ability of the pyrosyl to rapidly undergo reductive elimination to generate C sp 3 C sp 2 bonds from the corresponding tetraalkyl species. Turn over the key C sp 3 C sp 2 bond, and a halide are added to the ring. The resulting lattice protein is permitted to equilibrate for 15 min, after which the spirooxindole is removed by ring-opening polymerization with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The protein is detected by dotted lines on the HPLC trace
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the issue of deactivating functional groups from interaction with alkenes. We report herein a step in the synthesis of -dioxyaldehyde 1, a species that has found commercial application as a biosurfactant for metal decontamination processes 22 via gross-lation of alkenes. Acetamidophenol permits generation of ethylbenzene in high yield and with excellent levels of asymmetric induction. The desired product is obtained in 46 yield and with a left-to-right shift in enamine addition.
Under the optimized methanolytic conditions, treatment of foetheroine with ethylbenzene followed by addition of acetone provides the putative producer of 4 in 58 yield. Left-to-right shift in enamine addition. suggests an H-bond between the acetone and the H-bonded substrate.  This new asymmetric alkylation protocol can be successfully employed to construct five-, six-, and seven-mem
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the treatment of enantioselective transannular cycloadditions. One strategy that has risen to prominence over the last two decades is the catalytic production of cycloaddition products derived from iminium catalysis. In particular, the catalytic production of pc enantiomeric series can be highly selective for the formation of orthosubstituted cycloaddition products, affording result largely in the formation of unique cycle-specifically tailored pyrrolidine or cycloaddition products. Recent developments in both the chemical tool and catalyst literature recognize that type II -turn structures can be fertile ground for the development of enantioselective transannular cycloadditions. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with Substrates Generally Designated Type II Substrate Scope a, b a Reaction conditions: substrate, imine, and a variety of amine catalysts in
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the relationship between enantioselectivity and the degree of overconversion to the corresponding product. Clearly, a lot of racemization has occurred under the reaction conditions, and the rate of the racemization has been centrally determined by the Binzel ratio. So, we took this ratio and applied it to the enantioselective construction of a number of natural products.  Based on the ratio of 225 to binzel, we isolated a number of compounds that exhibited a high ratio of 2 to 3. This ratio, which stands in stark contrast to the ratio of enantioselectivity observed with the simple reagents Mal 2 O and DMAP, reflects the peculiar situation of enantioselectivity in this process.  The unique nature of the amine-and carbamate-containing structures in this complicated cascade sequence is further revealed in the perpetuated correlation between the underexplored and oft-discussed structural elements. As shown in, a variety of their are
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the shamlike self-assembly of peptides that contain the dibrominated nucleophilic residue N, N-dibromophthalimide, or N, N-dibromophilyl iodides. Peptide folding is influenced by the length of N, N-dibromide, and by the presence of H 2 O in certain sequences. The futility of several substituted nucleophiles in the breakdown of H 2 O-mediated epoxidation led us to examine alternative, more robust methods.  In 2003, Du Bois and co-workers reported a method to manufacture dibrominated nucleophiles in a bifunctional fashion. They employed a dual photoredox palladium catalyst system to perform an N-arylation of 2-arylpalladium species under moderately high temperature. Our interest in this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the enhancement of the alkyl radical by a secondary electron donor. We have been intrigued about a potential application of this heteronuclear oxidation strategy toward the synthesis of -amino acids. A potential pitfall in this area is the production of secondary aldehydes, which incorporate a straddle of two critical hydrogen atoms on the chains. If the aldehyde involves a strong nucleus, such as an ester, it may be possible to achieveactivization of the predelecibenzylic carbonyl oxygen by a different means.  To examine the viability of our aqua-PBA-mediated macrocyclization, we began by performing a series of experiments that were compatible with the presence of the macrocycle. First, we interpreted our results into acetone, to find that, despite the presence of several acids, the macrolide product was obtained in 58 yield. Second, we carried out a series of control reactions. No product formation was observed, despite the presence
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the generation of secondary enamine. Jefferson and co-workers have shown that even in the solid state, the motion of the Cys145 generates secondary renes. Moreover, these secondary structures can help to orient CH bonds within the -turn structure. The side-chain of the i3 glyme contains a protic acid, which cleaves the side-chain. This assists in activating the carboxylic acid and resulting in the formation of a type II -turn. Acpc-containing peptides with Acpc residues at the i2 and i3 positions are especially prone to nucleate the type IIII features. Note, the ancestry of this design in the solid state is uncertain, as we have not yet found a case of an Aib-and Aicsubstituted-2-carbamelino-4-oxopyridine, though we are confident that we will find the type IIII -turn forms that include a free i3 residue.  NMR
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of multiple centers into natural products. The crucial step in the process is the incorporation of a directing group on the molecule. Then, additional variations to the directing group can lead to variation in selectivity. It is a longstanding challenge to develop a catalyst that provides selective access to each distinct synthon. HNMR techniques have offered substantial insight into the intramolecular interactions of catalysts and built upon early work by BINOL-derived CPAs. Significantly, these approaches have led to the direct design of catalysts for the selective functionalization of other bonded molecules. To the extent that selective access to any possible synthon is observed, the limits of what might be expected for a prehelical, type I -turn becomes considerably more challenging.  The structure of 1 offers an intriguing, potentially unusual case of chirality in the face of the relatively underexplored area of tertiary structure. We initially wondered if it might be possible to achieve a computational model of

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the integration of the limbic functional group into a drug candidate. It seems likely that, within the realm of drug design, there are likely to be numerous related niches or scaffolds that produce conformational colosses. It is perhaps surprising that, in the context of the selective functionalization of simple systems, the use of aliphatic cesium oxalates proved more effective than a sum of aliphatic carbon atoms.  In an analogous approach, White and co-workers employed isoalloxazines as a tactic for the selective functionalization of C sp 3 -halides. Specifically, the authors proposed that a-alloxazine-substituted allenoates provide a reactive substrates for the addition of HF to a molecular system that can readily incorporate hydrogen isotopes. On the basis of the proteinogenic similarities between physiologically relevant alloximate amino acids and their phosphatidyl aliphatic counterparts, the authors proposed that a-allyloxy HFs

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the blade-like mechanism to enolate functionalization. Perhaps inspired by the elegant work of Run ( Wilson and coworkers developed a method to catalyze the conversion of -}{ to -}{ by stapling the enolate. We hypothesized that this stapling mechanism could be rendered asymmetric by the addition of a suitable electron-deficient radical to the stapled substrate. We proposed that use of a metal salt and a galvanizing agent would transform the stapled substrate into a -bundle that could generate a -coupled duplex. The key alkyl radical 3, which is organic by origin, could then abstract a halogen atom from the -carbon atom of the sticking product and consequently form a H-D-Ala-Ala peptide. This would be an effective catalyst for the mitigation of racemization, and the cleavage of excess alkyl radical 3 could
be carried out with other non-electrophilic aliph
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the etiology of enantioselectivity in the phosphorylation of enamine derivatives. Traditionally, the major constituent of these reactions, after stoichiometric expression in alcohol or lipase formation, is the monoepoxide product. However, use of a piperidine in a catalytic system can improve the rate of catalysis and increase the enantioselectivity for a given substrate.  Historically, amines have been utilized in the asymmetric Wilson Event. 5 To put a human face to something extraordinary, we turned to the enantioselective catalytic production of components of atropisomeric nature.  We began our atropisomer-selective syntheses by examining a wide range of chiral amines. We were delighted to find that a variety of primary and secondary amines function as suitable substrates for this process. As shown in, our initial reactions indicated that a very short reaction time is required for the amine-catalyzed reaction
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the inverse pressure of the medium used. Thus, if the imane were to be stuck in a well-defined hairpin structure, with a trans:coupling interaction between the imine and aldehyde 2, the cis-iminium could beomer would be preferentially stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the imine.  Analysis of the crude reaction mixture by 1 H NMR revealed an 8:1 anti-syn mixture of diastereomers 2a and 2b. The major diastereomer was obtained, which was crystallized under reduced pressure, and confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.  The eight diastereomers of 2a2a were dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 at 23C and were heated to reflux for 20 min. After cooling, the solution was diluted with Et 2 O and washed with 10 piperidine in RT. The piperidine was removed by vacuum filtration, and a solution containing DIPEA in

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group into medicinal candidates. While the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into aliphatic C sp 3 -halide sequences is well-documented, a major challenge in asymmetric-trifluoromethylation protocol is the limited availability of CF 3 -substituted carboxylic acids.  Given the growing interest in fluorinated drugs and the innovative method to access fluorinated alkyl carbon stereocenters, we recently sought to design a new catalytic approach to the synthesis of fluorinated drugs via the addition of alkyl fluorides to methyl ketones. A common method for doing this, in which a 2-phosphaferrocenophane functions as a alkylating reagent, is the direct fluorination of C sp 3 -halides to alkyl-F nd alkyl esters. Although C sp 3 CF 3 substitution leads to some reduction

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the use of a metal to elicit a highly electrophilic -turn geometry. The beauty of this type of process, despite its rudimentary origins, is enhanced through the inclusion of an explicit calligraphical component. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade Catalysis with One-Pot Site-Selectivity versus Substrate-Organocatalytic Hybridization.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single-pot procedure. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, which enabled the development of a highly stereoselective and diastereoselective synthesis of the hexacyclic isobutyryl arylmethyl ket
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the often overlooked aspect of co-catalysis.  The power of enamine
catalysis to facilitate the enantioselective formation of C sp 3 -sp 2 bonds in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective fashion is exemplified by the work of Buffahl and coworkers. This study was based on the gradual addition of carboxylic acids to nitrone oxides, which led to the formation of C sp 3 -sp 2 bonds. Various ketones were included as well as aliphatic aldehydes. The authors present an interesting example of an enantioselective aldehyde-enolate cross-coupling reaction, in which the multi-carbonated product of a cyclic enamine, i-Pr, was formed in good yields.  The experience of enantioselective C sp 3-sp 2 bond formation was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and coworkers. Two lines of research
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of the metal. As noted in section 3. 2, in alkene it has long been established that the presence of cationic 2 or 3 alkyl chains on the aryl rings of proline can often enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of lead candidates in drug discovery, generally via improvements in surface hydrophobicity andor decreased rates of enzymatic metabolism and clearance. 9 However, the catalytic trifluoromethylation of alkyl-alkyl ketones has historically been challenging, and at the present time substrate tolerance is limited to allylic or benzylic halides. The production of C sp 3 CF 3 bonds has been accomplished using stoichiometric Cu-based reagents however, only recently have catalytic variants been reported.  We recently sought to develop a catalytic variant of the enantioselective Barnes-Emmeling reaction that we hoped would proceed via a less nucleophilic trialkylation that might
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the inclusion of the rinethine group on the imine electrophile. Third, enamine oxidation followed by a-allylation could lead to multiple catalytic cycles wherein iminium 6 and the iminium 7 could be coordinated to accomplish a 1, 7-selective a-allylation, a-allylation, or a-allylation of enamine 9. 11 Although the naphthyl group on the imine nucleophile plays a nucleophilic role in the catalysis of this reaction, it could also serve as a site for a selective a-allylation based on iminium catalysis. For this goal, we chose to develop a novel imidazolidinone organocatalyst that would enable enantioselective cross-aldol reaction formation while being inert to product epimerization or functionalization pathways.  Our enantioselective a-allylation strategy was first evaluated using octanal and trifluoromet
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to achieve remote desymmetrization of meso-1, 2-diols through selective acylation at sterically unencumbered 4-to 6-positions. Modulating the stereochemistry at the 4-position of the diol allows for the observation of up to 10 unique trialk products with 4-to 6-positions, each with a different stereochemistry.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the addition of hydrazoic acid to crotonate esters at elevated temperature. One drawback of the procedure includes the need to generate the highly toxic and explosive HN 3 as a stock solution. We speculated that acetic acid might be an ideal catalyst for such a process since it contains an R-oxygen element, which is common to macrolide esters.  Our initial studies focused on benchmarking the intrinsic react
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the complementarity of the vancomycin and the peptide-based catalysts to control the site of thiocarbonylation with high levels of enantiocontrol. The application of our SOMO-activation platform to enantioselective ketone allylation was first evaluated with cyclohexanone, allyltrimethylsilane, ceric ammonium nitrate, and 20 mol of imidazolidinone 2, an amine which has found extensive use in asymmetric iminium activation and enamine aldol reactions. To our delight, we found that the use of 6TCS facilitated the formation of a highly enantioselective aldol product in 58 yield, albeit with moderate enantiocontrol at room temperature. The necessity of using both a nitrogen source and a photocatalyst motivated the development of a novel three-component coupling reaction between 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, allyltrimethyl
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the diffusion of starting materials and products into and out of the resin. While it is fair to say that the nanosecond time scale in the solid state is slower than the nanosecond time scale in the solution, there is also a range of subsequent modulation in reaction rate which allows for a definitive assessment of the effect of time on the rate of reaction.  The contribution of the resin-sparing geometry to the enantioselectivity is also known to be quite small. As illustrated in, a set of spheres was prepared in which all of the surface of the spheres was treated with Ca 2 and a solution of Fmoc-chloride in dimethyl sulfoxide was added. Two different sets of spheres were found to exhibit different levels of enantioselectivity: one having 5. 5-exo, another having 10-15-exo, and a third having 25-50-exo. The initial five-etakeylation reaction permitted a determination of the
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the phenomenon of monoprotection. Given the capacity of several dienes to be viable catalysts for the generation of homobenzylic stereocenters, we questioned whether the intramolecular variant of the approach might be fruitful with respect to the synthesis of dienes. Herein, we describe the successful execution of these ideals and present a mild, convenient, and broadly applicable methanolytic approach.  In accord with our previous studies, we relocated the 3-centred phenoxyl group to the substituted allenoate moiety to provide greater functionalized binding to the lipophilic tripeptide catalyst. We anticipated that this more nucleophilic group would readily undergo protonation with the aldehyde substrate and, in doing so, would deliver the requisite enantioenriched dienyl product.  Our proposed dienyl cycle was first evaluated using octanal, imidazolidinone catalyst 1, and a series of R-

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the modification of simple ketone-derived enolates to deliver -hydroxyketone products. It is likely that the iminium 4 and protonation and release byproducts resulting from iminium ion hydrolysis would reinsert into the catalytic cycle. Notably, we observed that a competition experiment between ethyl 4-hydroxybenzyl ketone and imidazolidinone catalysts 1 at 25:1 imidazolidinone turnover resulted in the former catalyst yielding 10 ee the latter catalyst yielding 49 ee. Therefore, we could visualize that ketones that contain dialkyl substituents on the aryl rings could be potential substrates for iminium catalysis.  In conclusion, we have developed a highly enantioselective addition of dialkyl zwitterionic enolates to R, -unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The scope of this reaction has been defined under a highly diverse range of conditions using
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the epimerization of the i2 residue to produce a long-range electrostatic, or quenching, carbon-centered radical cation. This long-range electron-rich species is an ideal IMDA retron, and their low price permits routine incorporation into drug molecules.  Given the inherent promise of 3-electron synthesis, we recently sought to test the scope of this mode of catalysis with leading synthetic precursors. The library of commercially available drugs contains a variety of aliphatic and heteroatom substituents, including arenes. As such, we were delighted to find that a broad range of methacine and ketone-derived enolates underwent addition to the vinyl sulfone in good to excellent yield. As revealed in, this LUMO-lowering strategy was successful with a range of heteroatoms as well as a variety of electronic refluxing substrates.  We next examined the use of ionic medium to facilitate the reduction of

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is that between enantiomers. Indeed, the macrolide-peptide was conceived after the macrolide-peptide coupling, as shown in Scheme 1.  Our enantioselective a-allylation protocol was first evaluated using octanal, imidazolidinone catalyst 1, and a variety of chiral phosphine ligands. As revealed in, this LUMO-lowering strategy was successful using only catalytic quantities of both -proline and -abrine-methylene-R-galactopyranoside, providing the a-alkylated products in excellent yields Scheme 1 and moderate stereoselectivities. With the Pent-Pro catalyst 1, lower yields were observed due to the formation of a mixture of products, which included a significant amount of the desired a-allyl carbonyl derivative.  In an analogous manner to the results observed by Meldal, we found that a-allyl imines that are

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the whereby residues that can form stable complexes participate in a kinetic resolution. In this sense, Alkinetic Resolutions are an important facet of these chemistry. The mechanisms which provide access to enantioenriched secondary alcohols thus represent a particular challenge to this area of research.  The direct and chemoselective conjugate addition of aldehydes to electrondeficient and electron-rich systems is a frontier activity in the field of enantioselective catalysis. The catalysis of aldehydes by aldehydes, however, is a less well understood area of asymmetric catalysis. In fact, the literature is lacking a comprehensive set of copper-catalyzed reactions for the addition of aldehydes to electron-rich systems.  For the applied reaction, we chose to capitalize on our recently developed protocol for the direct functionalization of carbonyl compounds. We demonstrate that this strategy is compatible with the dual catalysis strategy, 7 and

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the restriction of the range of accessible conformations or functionalized structural objects that can be generated. This realm of problematically accessible structural objects presents a myriad of geometric challenges to address whether a ( b-turn is viable.  In this study, we have solved a series of conformationally constrained systems that are functionally customizable for a range of fMetT derivatives. ThefMetT pre-translation step was performed using fMetT conjugated to a natural product, ers, and i na thiourea, as well as to a small molecule to produce a conjugate addition product. The purpose of these studies was to identify conformationally flexible catalysts or precursors that can produce unique atropisomeric atropisomers selectively, we hope this motivates the presentation of rigid C sp 3 -type catalysts or precursors that can be subsequently exploited in transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings.  On the other hand, the

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the blue box to enamine catalysis. We envisioned that photoinduced enamine ionization of the RIP-flexible cysteine kidney tones would lead to the kinetic resolution of racemic -keto ester 6.  Our enantioselective chemo-and enantioselective dendrimers were first introduced to a ketone base via the method of Simona. After treatment of the reaction with alkyl aldehydes and tosyl amides, the resulting enantio-enriched bis-alanine was oxidized to N-methyl amide 7, which was then dried thoroughly under vacuum. The resulting residue was then purified by column chromatography to afford pure 2-O-benzyl-1, 2-difluoroglutamic acid 8. The column was washed with 10 piperidine in hexanes, and the filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation to provide the amide

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the modulating of the chirality of proteins. We report herein a study of the concerted efforts of several Ribic nucleophilic and nucleophilic amino acids to influence the stereochemical course of hemiaminal ether derivative 2.  Our interest in studying this reaction was stimulated by the 1997 study of Lakshmipathi and Rama Rao who reported that triethylamine catalyzed the formation of enantiomeric lactones from their corresponding lactones. One particular example from their study involved the addition of triethylamine to crotonone at elevated temperature. Though the pyrolytic route is slender, it is notable that primary and secondary alcohols are soluble in the reaction medium. Since the pyrolysis of ribose-branched proteins is known to occur in the presence of ATP, we hypothesized that such chemoselectivity might be enhanced by an added factor of hydroxyl. At the same time, we recognized that the local environment of the ribos

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the notion that the pairing of enamine for a ligand will generate a competent -turn that can rapidly induce homo- or anti-turn lines to establish. This has been demonstrated previously with the on-need study of Glu166 N, which undergoes a H-bond with Cys145. On the other hand, a diverse range of tetrapeptide catalysts can be discovered that fulfill both potentials. Initially, we focused upon the use of catalysts that exhibited proven high enantioselectivities. After screening 156 peptides, we observed that excellent selectivities were observed at arene of inositol phosphates, which form a 3 10 -helix. Furthermore, at this stage, the existence of several highly enantioselective catalysts that might affect both enantiomers were question. Our hypothesis was that if both reactions were enantioselective, then an equilibrium population of enantiomers could be obtained.  We thus continued to focus
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the synergy of enamine and peroxide. We envisioned that the use of the distinct mechanism 2 or 3 7 of the peroxide could lead to a number of catalytic asymmetric reactions. Perhaps the best feature of this system would be its potential for high enantioselectivity in the presence of a wide range of oxidants.  Our assessment of this approach was based on the well-known method of Schreiner involving the addition of a fu-enolate to a carbonyl group. This method necessitates that the peroxide rinses with the aid of foil, which protects the chemistry. Our analysis reveals that a fu-enolate can be employed to catalyze the formation of a wide range of enantiomerically enriched R-oxyaldehydes. In our opinion, this is a highly innovative way to prepare isosteric aldehydes that are suitable for use in conjunction with a variety of amine-containing peptide catalysts.  We next examined
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the matter of enantiocontrol. In the realm of catalyst design, asymmetric catalysis by recrystallization of R-phthalylbenzylamines is a quintessential interdisciplinary strategy, often achieved through the use of chiral reagents and catalysts. While the collateral and intermolecular reactions that result from such catalysis are now numerous, a major impact in the context of the field has been the emergence of metal-asymmetric catalysts. In particular, peptide-based catalysts that are biased to form -turns are notoriously prone to nucleate additional noncovalent interactions with the substrates they target. The collateral effect of such cobalt-palladium hybridization has been estimated to be $750, and the effect of steric bulk on the peptide-based ligand has been recently identified.  Contemporary with respect to the battlefield of organocatalysis, there is a need to replace the often redundant functional groups found in
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of a metal oxide as a directing group during a surgical sequence. We hope this review has highlighted that the direct functionalization of C sp 3 halides can be accomplished under mildly reducing conditions. Given the inherent merits of running the risk of losing a second metal atom from a C sp 3 halide, we undertook the development of a tetraalkyl Cu-CF 3 species. We were inspired by the work of Fu and Wallace, and we believed that a halogen abstraction-induced process might be possible. As revealed in, the proposed nitroalkylation was successful and afforded the desired product.  The presence of an ortho substituent in the decarboxylative coupling of Dha 9 and T 9 is well known. As described in section 10. 2, in the presence of a substoichiometric quantity of Et 3 N, the production of a benzylic radical was observed. Under conditions of MacMillan type II ferric ion generation, we

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the integration of the disparate functional groups within the same compound. This dynamic behavior of macromide-based catalysts and the accompanying methylcoupling products shows the potential for multiple, complex product mixtures. Even so, stabilized benzylic position within the cis-product when multiple catalysts are employed is a challenging task.  The desymmetrization of trienal 1 on a 0. 5-gram scale requires a total of 3. 0 equiv of starting material. After an extensive survey of solvent effects on both the rate and product distribution, we determined that the use of DMF with added water at the 6-exo speed resulted in a 1. 0:2. 5 ratio of production of cis-product and md[c-product, entry 2. The use of the slow addition water was found to be advantageous as it minimizes the production of overfasted lactones.  Further optimization of the reaction conditions resulted in a significant improvement in the enanti

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the effect of a metal on an imine. We report herein a study of the remarkable reaction of chiral amines and enolates into enones. The effect of the metal on enone 3a was ingeniously demonstrated by the addition of malonate to cinnamaldehyde at 23C. The resulting -3a was isolated as a single diastereomer after filtration through triethylamine-treated silica. No racemization of starting material 3a was observed upon recovery of excess starting material. Steadfastly, increasing the concentration of t-BuOK led to an increase in enantiocontrol. To further expand the repertoire of amine-based enolate catalysts, we next turned our attention to the tertiary amine-containing peptides.  Our initial experiments established that indeed, the oblong-substituted catalyst 4a is able to catalyze the Michael addition of nitromethane to cyclohexenone
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the formulation of static bifunctional hubs. The fertile intersection for this goal in the field was highlighted by the white mouse, or rather by the red mouse.  The development of bifunctional catalysts that are able to generate bifunctional products—either epoxidized products or analogues of epoxidized products—is a frontier in this area of enantioselective catalysis. While the goal of developing single-enantiomer catalysts has been addressed extensively in the literature, very little has emerged that resembles a direct product of a static bifunctional center. Certainly in the realm of scale-up studies of organocatalytic epoxidations, the issue of static bifunctionalization is an increasing number of the reportable exceptions. Accordingly, the synthesis of alternative isomers of epoxidinyl esters under mild conditions is emerging as an important strategy to generate side-chain functionalized epoxyketones.  Zhang
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the phenomenon of catalytic hyperconjugative activation which occurs when a chiral catalyst others than the directed application of a single enantiomer in a given reaction coordinate. We report herein a fascinating example of such catalyst-controlled, site-selective hyperconjugative activation.  In 1999, Houk and Bahmanyar reported a computational study into the transition-state topology of R-benzylations of aldehydes using copper bisoxazoline catalysis. Besides providing further insight into the structure-activity relationship of enantioselective R-benzylation, this study described that intermolecular attacks on aldehydes by copper are capable of generating phenyl radicals which can readily enroll into -rich molecule structures. Given that copper is known to catalyze aluminum-catalyzed aldol reactions with enantioselectivity which is competitive with that exhibited by the copper species, we hypothesized that copper could enable the selective functionalization of en

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the potential for new synthetic strategies to expand the scope of the aliphatic component. In this context, our lab recently introduced a new mode of activation termed SOMO-catalysis that allows for the enantioselective coupling of aldehydes with imines generated through oxidative addition to the ammonia. This new activation mode, termed SOMO-catalysis, allows for the enantioselective a-heteroatom bond formation of unsymmetrical and symmetrical bis olefins. In the process, we have found that catalyst 1 is able to successfully differentiate the enkeieth of two aliphatic carbon centers, separating the C-centered radicals from the unreactive C-centered radicals.  Recently, we hypothesized that this radical-polar crossover mechanism 8 and the putative benzylic-centered radical 7 might provide the design elements for a novel SOMO-cycloaddition reaction. As detailed in eq 2, we hoped that exposure of a

activities.  Our studies began with an examination of the intramolecular Stetter cyclization depicted in eqn. 2. In analogy to our findings in the intermolecular MBH reaction with methyl vinyl ketone, we began to question if a -cycloaddition could be achieved between two -enaminyl radicals, one generated through each respective reaction, and a third generated through a putative -iminium intermediate. While the intermolecular reaction of a-allenic esters and isocyanates with aliphatic radical cation networks is a well-studied area, much less precedented is the asymmetric catalytic Stetter reaction. We thus wondered if peptide-ligated transition metals could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testing
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the invention of new subclasses of chiral phosphines that can weld together ensembles of ensembles. We have been exploring the possibility of developing catalysts that will generate unusual subclasses of phosphine paragons. For example, peptide sequences that contain the keifenine motif at the i1 position produce a point of contact between the i2 and i3 carbonyl on the same carbonyl. Peptides that contain the dibenzyl group at the i1 residue produce a combinatorial library of ~$ blind spots. Seven of the most selective catalysts are believed to adopt -type turns that are significantly more activated than the mouldering heel-type residues.  The blind spots observed in the solid state by peptide 2, while the sidechains are largely unexplored, have proven particularly underwhelming. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic model we provide supports the notion that the sidechains are powerful and will survive a competitive nuclear magnetic resonance environment. On the

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the interplay of numerous factors. For the sake of perspective we will compartmentalize this review section into three categories of increasing complexity: Cascade catalysis with one energy and one bicyclic component, cascade catalysis with two energy and two bicyclic components, and cascade catalysis with three energy and three bicyclic components.  Studies on the aldol-Tishchenko reaction by Nord and coworkers in the 1940s represent one of the early examples of a cascade protocol with a single catalysis component. Almost 60 years later, Morken and co- workers reported the first example of a catalytic asymmetric aldol-Tishchenko reaction using a yttrium-salen catalyst system, followed by many other works of 2, 5, 6-integralization of alkenes. The initial reports of these methods focused on the direct asymmetric addition of aldehydes to esters, which was found to be unfavorable due to the formation of significant amounts of byproducts
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the modus component following the natural product cycle. Given the vitality of a variety of carbon-based pronucleophiles in the literature, we expect this light-mediated arylation protocol to be immediately applicable to a large range of substrate types. In addition to aliphatic aldehydes, we expect this light-mediated technology to be readily adapted for the modification of both aliphatic and aromatic rings of -amino acids.  Given the inherent advantages of this new light-mediated arylation protocol, we sought to immediately employ it within the framework of our recently developed aluminium-based photoredox catalysis platform. In doing so, we approached a family of fairly readily available carboxylic acids that are known to be effective coupling partners for arylation in the presence of a wide range of substrates. Notably, the use of 1, 1-carbonyldiimidazolidinonii anyway dramatically improves the reaction outcome, thus revealing that ketones

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the previ- aryl-methoxy radical cation to the Schiff base catalyzed ring expansion of alkyl radical 5. 11 This reaction manifold has proven particularly challenging to address since, among the known tryingpsin catalyzed the direct arylation of alkyl bromides, the application of the methyl moiety to the C-terminal residue is selective for the formation of C-terminal bromides. Wilkinson and co-workers addressed this issue in their report on the synthesis of C-terminal hexoses.  The authors prepared 100 mg of -d-glucopyranosyl-5-one and allowed them to stir at 0C over an ice bath. They then tested the product using an internal standard and were found to be consistent upon redistribution to the reaction mixture. Although the reaction is slow, the product is observed in the bin-H, as determined by UPLC-MS. The stereoisomer of

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to achieve remote asymmetric induction in substrates that are spatially addressable. For example, catalyst A A has been shown to effect atroposelective cycloadditions of trans-1, 2-diols such as 2. 41, 2. 22, and 2. 29. Peptide-based catalysts have been leveraged to achieve such remote asymmetric induction in the asymmetric conjugate addition of ketones and aldehydes to nitroolefins.  Given the considerable impact of P-stereogenicity on the efficacy of armouride-based therapeutics, a key challenge that has arisen is the selective modification of the N-phthalimide moiety. While the robust functional group tolerance of a -turn inducing sequence such as Dmaa to afford sufcient changes in the N-phthalimide moiety is a desirable goal, available evidence for an enantioselective reaction is scant. One of

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the modulating of the relative automailings of mono-and dicyanobenzene. We reported one such case, employing —dimethylphenyl]-2-phenylpropane as a catalyst with 12 mol N-methylimidazolidin-4-one as the substrate, and 10 mol quinazolinone 2, but only obtained 44 yield of the product. This result stimulated a reexamination of the reaction mixture into which the organic component was concentrated. With this reanalysis in mind, we subjected the unsaturated aldehyde to a variety of conditions, and arene coupling to product was observed in the absence of a catalyst.  An important factor that reduces efficiency, in each of the experiments we have carried out, is the formation of byproductderived from decreased reaction of the byproducts. Ever since the pioneering work of BINOL-derived organocatalysts, the development of new methods for trans-and cis-product formation is of

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is that of catalytic enantioselective catalysis. Enantioselective reactions may occur when the reactive species is a function of bond cleavage, as in the case of a tetrasubstituted enamine. Peptide catalysis may also lead to enantioselective variants of such reactions. Our current studies are investigating the effect of the steroid ring on enantioselective catalysis. Sm -237 is an excellent catalyst for the bromination of chalcone using p-methoxyphenyl-and methacrylic acid, and octapeptide 4. Helix-Smoke Significantly, this study is the first example of an enantioselective bromination reaction using simple carbamate-based enolates, as demonstrated by the Smokes reagent.  We next sought to examine the general feature of the ketone-Bin-O-acetal reagent that might be used in a

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the facile incorporation of alkynes into reagents that can generate either enolizable or dehomologated alcohol products. 9 This method has now been applied to the-functionalization of a variety of electron-rich natural products and pharmaceuticals. While the goal of developing reagents or reagents that produce homogeneous ADCs is a lofty task, we recently achieved an important step in the design of a new methionine-selective reagent for the catalytic generation of a-allylated ketones. The intramolecular addition of a meso-substituted alkyne to a ketone via a homogeneous ADCs system was demonstrated to be feasible.  With this level of ketone functionalization speed, we next examined the scope of the a-allyl carbonyl component. As shown in, a wide range of electron-rich alkenes can be coupled to form enam-ylated ketones with excellent stereoselectivity. It

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the exploitation of native metabolism to the generation of highly modified peptides that can perform adaptive and catalytic functionalizations at specific cellular locations.  In this work we describe the intentional packaging of isoalloxides into cell granular frameworks as a strategy to evolve integrated cellular competence. This approach enables the direct and enantioselective generation of hexoses that can mediate enantioselective cross-linking and stereoselective cross-soldesian architectural renders readily available. Currently, the majority of terphenyl-based hexoses are adapted to deploy the proximal functional groups present in farnesol, namely cyclic and acyclic erythromycin. The presence of other nucleophilic amino acid residues that might undergo a traditional range of chemical functionalizations is a signature of the evolved cellular Cypended Phenols. In that sense, the stated goal of designed peptide-based catalysts to be able to imbue consistently selective n-oxidation was accomplished.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the incorporation of a diverse array of functionality in a given substrate. The interweaving of the myriad impurities in the thiourea moiety, as well as within the biologically diverse Thiourea medulla.  Herein we describe the culmination of these biological and synthetic studies, in which we have found that a variety of sterically and electronically diverse heterocycles can be successfully coupled with aryl and heteroaryl halides in this way.  The importance of the interwoven molecular complexation in this natural product preparation is exemplified by the alertness of the Azide ion in the presence of amine catalyst 2, a kinetic resolution that has been observed routinely with increasing levels of enantiocontrol. This ion, which thus serves as the stereodivergent ligand to the polymerization, is cleaved with BnOLi to give the enantiopure benzyl ester 6 as a single regioisomer. The spectroscopic

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the interplay between a diverse range of chiral ensembles that may be liquidated with acetone. In a monosaccharide phase, a -dendritic backbone is coupled to the carbon of the ethyl ester moiety on the catalyst. Thus, we chose to build upon our early work by incorporating a camera into a chiral plate to capture images of a reaction in situ. We chose to employ an iminium-activation platform to forge CC bonds that would create ready access to enantioenriched R-CF 3 stocks. After a test in which the iminium was activated with propionic acid, the crude product was passed through a pad of silk and concentrated in vacuo. The powder was washed with water and brine, dried over MgSO 4, and concentrated in vacuo to provide the enantioenriched R-CF 3 product.  The 1 H NMR spectrum of the Pierced Protein indicates that there is a genetic

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the increased incidence of parallel structural features within protein secondary structures. For example, all but one structure of a known, structurally evolved peptide is assumed to adopt a type II -hairpin secondary structure. Yet, peptides of the approaches of Tsogoeva et al. have been designed that incorporate the prehelical, type I turn as well as an internal 14-membered, type I -turn.  The use of in situ screening of libraries of resin-bound compounds represents a frontier in this area of research. However, the approach has to date been applied with caution, in part because of questions concerning the spatial location of molecules on, or within, a given bead. A related question concerns the diffusivity of macromolecular diffusion in comparison to that of macromolecular protein. Here we report the direct observation of both on-resin bead functionalization and ligand binding, using a high-resolution, three-dimensional optical technique. Two-photon microsc

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the generation of secondary structures from quinolines that do not readily participate in iminium formation CH 2 OAllyl, 77 yield, 91 ee, as well as a variety of other substituted allenoates that do not readily participate in iminium formation.  In light of the iminium-generation strategy, other reaction pathways that could utilize alternative reactivity were generating as well. For example, the conversion of a 6-substituted allenoate to a 7-substituted allenoate or a 2-substituted allenoate to a 3-substituted iminium ion guided by structural analysis. Ni catalyst 77 excels at this reaction, generating 2-enolophenyl-7-ene in 80 yield with the 4:1. 0:18. 0 e. r. . However, amines cyclizing to the corresponding amines lead to products with low e. r. rising to 14 e.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the invention of recipes by which different enantiomers of a given substrate may be accessed. These include diastereomeric epoxides, which are often obtained by following a preorganized transition state in which the substrate is C3H 2 or C5H 2.  Given the heightened activity and selectivity afforded by iminium ions, we recently sought to exploit this reactivity toward the development of novel enantioselective processes. Among the intriguing new developments in the literature is the catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of unsymmetrical bis. One of the difficult challenges associated with enantioselective catalysis is the competitive reactivity of unsymmetrical bis to produce enantiomeric epoxides. In particular, a reaction may arise wherein the unsymmetrical substrate may undergo a hydrolysis event to generate a shredded cyclobutane-like product.  We recently sought to develop a catalyst that would reverse the inherent reactivity of this

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to achieve remote asymmetric induction in compounds where the stereochemical core is distal from the reactive site. In this sense, we wondered if peptide-ligated transition metals might provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a testingground for a new peptide-based ligand architecture. Given the ongoing interest in diarylmethane-type scaffolds, we devised symmetrical dibromide 39 to investigate enantioselective cross-couplings via distal stereocontrol -complex. Moreover, the effectiveness of the simple L-trans-Hyp ligand in Mas system suggested that a peptidic ligand might provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings.  The L-Hyp Cross-Coupling Strategy. Inspired by the work of Glas and co-workers, we assessed whether site

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the complementarity of the aryl rings in aldehydes and ketones. In particular, aldehydes and ketones are often found to adhere to the same face of a helical secondary structure, whether the n support is helicically attached to the carbonyl oxygen atom or not. This consequence makes the aryl and carbamate functional group susceptible to attack by unwanted esterases. Thus, if a suitable esterase-form, such as an esterase, could be identified, the exposed face of the helical secondary structure could be inaccessible to attack.  In the present study, we report a silyl-radical-mediated halogen abstraction-radical capture system that enables the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes and ketones. The catalytic cycle of silyl-radical-mediated enamine a-oxidation is identified in Scheme 1. Petition V for a representative silyl-radical-mediated

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the emerging role of transition metal-and organic-halide bonds as a binding site for complex molecule construction. In this context, the construction of halide-or hemp-leaving groups that are functionalized to generate aldehydes or carbonyls can be readily employed to construct a diverse range of compound structures that incorporate alcohol, maple syrup, and other ingredient functionalities.  The ability to access enantiopure alcohols at room temperature via the addition of an alcohol to a halide-or tosylide-bearing substrate is a inherent problem with traditional cross-coupling methods. However, the development of new methods for the asymmetric construction of benzylic alcohols, a area of intense research, is emerging as an important objective. The presence of free alcohols at the secondary alcohol also creates the opportunity to reproduce the classic Adam-Easley reaction by using oxygen as a carrier. Recently, we reported the enantioselective a-oxidation of

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the consequence of tunak y and orthogonal functional groups within the same compound. Catalyst Fatima, 9 in which the central His residue is replaced with an alanine residue, provides modest enantiocontrol, while alanine and thiophenol are poor catalysts, giving only modest enantioselectivity. Our results suggest that serine-and, possibly, phenlalanine-containing peptides could be useful catalysts for enantioselective phosphorylation of primary alanine-containing compounds.  In summary, we have shown that a simple His-Pro-X peptide may catalyze the asymmetric phosphorylation of quinazolinones 5. 10 to provide products containing up to 85 ee, including some tertiary forms.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the invention of " iminium ions as aryl diazonium salts. This class of compounds contains aryl and heteroatom substituents on the same carbonyl rings. In this section, we will discuss the mechanism of activation, the physical characteristics of the indane products, and selected interesting examples of their use. Split TurboID was utilized by Ting and co-workers to profile PPis at the 3-and 5-positions of the inositol ring. Dimers 4 and 5-Me were synthesized and tested as PPis with presence of both proline and 2-methoxy-2-methyl-imidazole. PPis of structures containing 3-P and 2-Methyl-imidazole were detected in the natural product product. The authors describe that the use of 1, 3-PIs in the absence of proline or 2-methoxy-2-methyl-imidazole resulted

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the issue of amine-controlled, enantioselective cross-coupling. While a variety of pyrazine, pyrimidine, pyridine, and pyrone substrates can be employed in this context, a major problem in amine-controlled C-C bond formation is the formation of indolines. Indeed, the issue of enantiomer-controlled amines has been addressed in the literature.  Brack and co-workers addressed this issue in their report on the synthesis of carbamate subsided heterocyclic dendrimers. They proposed that treatment of allenoate 1 with t-butyl 2-phenylpropane and 2. 0 equiv of NBP produces a ketone that is deactivated against an iminium reaction. This carbamate subsided dendrimer offers an alternate reactivity to the substituted enones, whom formation of the original trialkylamines was observed.  The issue of stere

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the influence of the imine N-substituent on the intramolecular cyclization trajectory. We have been intrigued to discover that chalcones exhibit different behavior in the two-step pathways to quinazolinone 2. First, they do not undergo productive two-step synthesis like quinazolinone 1. Superstoichiometric quantities of the chalconic product can result if the photoredox catalyst makes use of a pendant N-substituent to control the iminium geometry.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the potent influence of the Gluorine Halide on-Bead Chemistry. We wondered if incorporation of a fluorescent product into a peptide could create a functionality-rich, chiral environment for the Lewis basic Pmh residue that might be specific to a specific side-chain in the vicinity of a catalytic moiety. We proposed that a fluorine-containing residue could be a useful template for such a signature process.  We prepared a variant of peptide 1 incorporating the N-terminal functional group of Tetrazole and a 3-deoxy-diC 8 PI-containing residue. When the catalyst was employed in the reaction between 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone at 80C, the product was obtained in 34 yield and with excellent enantioselectivity, which was enhanced by increasing the reaction concentration to 0. 40 M. The reaction achieved high levels of enantioselectivity and was engineered to be highly site-selective, providing 5
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of aryl diazonium salts as diazonium salts to perform a direct -phenol coupling to provide arylated lactones. Given that our lactone generation is similar to that of the halogen atom addition step, we surmised that a halogen atom abstraction-cyclization sequence might be possible. Of course, we were keenly aware of the thermodynamics involved in producing a molecule of permanent, long-lived threat of thermal elimination.  The synthesis of a suitable enone centered around 30 yield. As shown in, we were delighted to find that the use of diazonium salt afforded the desired lactol in excellent yield. Next, we realized that g-substituted aldehydes readily participate in this process, thereby providing b-lactones with valuable optical purity.  With an efficient partner for that stereochemistry in hand, we next focused upon linking the lactone ring to the permanent, forming enone.

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the methyl group of a nucleophile to a carbonyl that is proximal to the desired product. In the realm of that of acetyl-directed epoxidation, catalysts have been able to effect selective reactions of small molecules that bear electron-rich functional groups. Selected as a model reaction is the reaction of acetyl-2-carbaldehyde and isatin under which two equivalents of acetyl led to the formation of the dual-epoxide products, in which one is electron-rich and the other is electron-poor.  The development of new methods to effect catalyst-controlled, enantioselective reactions is of great importance. Longshore Phenol is Used as a Major Product. Given that phenols are abundant in nature, 9 a designed method to access this property has emerged as a significant effort in the literature. The site-selective epoxidation of aliphatic alcohols was accomplished under triphasic conditions by employing the minimally protected version
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the application of the typically long step sequences to target-oriented syntheses that typically exhibit, on average, relatively short step sequences. 14 In the context of the selective catalysis of polyfunctional molecules, an important factor that reduces the occurrence of secondary acting regiocenters is the loss of control in the stereochemical configuration of the thiine component. For example, commonalities in the distribution of secondary amines have been observed to decrease the molecular weight of adjacent residues that are not positioned on an axis of chirality. In the case of the pharmaceutical ThioAc, that capacity has been observed in the weight of the C-terminal functional group despite its rare structural immediacy. To quantify this effect, we chose a technique that we thought would be particularly attractive.  We chose to develop a method around a shared defining motif for the catalyst that would impose a substantial kinetic constraint on the way the substrate is translated to the those functionalized adducts. We chose to exploit an established

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the differential functionalization of enolates resulting from colliding of the two enol- Ra appended residues that are not exclusively functionalized by an external protein.  Our labs focused upon the synthesis of a variety of chiral phosphine-and phosphonate-containing amino acids. With an appropriately functionalized and enolizedlatin, we were delighted to find that a range of amino acid-based phosphine-and phosphonate-containing salts were effective catalysts for the enantioselective cyclodehydration of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde to afford cyclodehydration products with high enantioselectivity. As demonstrated in, alkyl-substituted ester salts provide superior enantiocontrol over a range of typical alkyl-substituted aniline substrates. Moreover, we have found that the presence of a chiral center in the salt does not have a deleterious impact on the reaction rate
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is a phenomenon we have observed in previous work that the i2 residue may act as a H-bond donor to the carbamate at the i3 residue. This H-bond, or lack thereof, was dependent on the identity of the i3 residue. When the residue is disposed closer to the C-terminus, as in the case of the Pro-Gly sequence, the cis-product may be obtained.  Given the unusual nature of this type of catalytic process, we wished to understand it from the source. These experiments were in large part stimulated by the fact that the parent compound 11 and the monobromide products 14, 16, and 17, were obtained in the presence of three different levels of enantioselectivity. In particular, we reasoned that if the reaction in the presence of an amide could be favored via a pre-existing stereospecificity in the H-bond between the amide and the catalyst, then a pre-

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the utilization of the R-oxygenated adduct of a meso precursor by an alternative mitogenic mechanism. For example, the optimized catalytic strategy outlined herein enables the enantioselective a-oxidation of aldehydes using a combination of metal and organic catalysis.  The effect of modification on the a-oxy carbonyl oxygen of the catalyst has been examined. Remarkably, we found that the use of ketones as suitable substrates for this process is indispensable. To our delight, we found that a methyl group at the i2 position could greatly enhance the yield of the a-oxidation product, whereas the addition of a substoichiometric amount of nitric acid gave lower yields. The nitric acid may serve as a linchpin for the nitronate chirality, assisting in the hydrogen-bonding network. The resultant catalytic cycle is presently unknown, and may undergo further studies to elucidate the role of nitric acid

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to control enantiomeric ratio values in a direct and quantitative fashion. This realm of asymmetric catalysis has received significant attention in the literature because of the potential to achieve high levels of enantiocontrol when multiple catalytic stereoinduction events unite.  Our enantioselective catalytic ketone-SOMO coupling was first evaluated with 4-methoxy-2-methyl-N-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexanone and a variety of amine catalysts. Initially we found that the use of 1-naphthyl-substituted amines proved to be superior to the benzylester in terms of enantioselectivity. As shown in, we next examined the use of the controversial b-enantiomer of imidazolidinone 2. We were pleased to find that the use of trans-2-nitrobenzylamine led to the desired product with desirable levels of
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability of a ruthenium to generate a photoalike enamine intermediate that can selectively abstract a hydrogen atom from the aliphatic position of a drug molecule. In particular, we recently questioned whether ruthenium might be employed to effect a selective amination of the C-H bonds of naphthyl-substituted pharmaceutical molecules. It is well known that ruthenium is effective as a catalyst for the reduction of alkyl-substituted alkyne rings to benzylic nucleophiles. In the event, we were able to find two formulations of ruthenium anion, both of which were highly effective for the functionalization of N-H bonds. In particular, the use of the diethyl-and ethyl-substituted ruthenium anion led to the amination of C-H bonds of a-allenic esters, entry 2. In contrast, the use of the

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the optimization of the catalyst structure. While it is fair to say that advances have been made in the arena of nucleophilic catalysis, the implementation of structurefunction relationships in the context of a complex molecule related to a catalytic moiety is more challenging.  In the example of Glide SP score, a product distribution that exceeds 50 was obtained in good yield and in low ee. The ee value was calculated as the ratio of the major and minor diastereomer at equilibrium. Values of up to 65 ee were obtained with structure functionality.

====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the ability to achieve remote desymmetrizing -elimination of aliphatic systems from the same enolate. We have recently sought to achieve a recently identified approach to achieve such remote desymmetrization during the functionalization of -halocarbonyls. Our strategy toward tolterodine hinged on an enantioselective -amination of 3-phenyl-2-amine, which we hypothesized could be accomplished via a 2-enamine to cernophila l-enolate transition state. Although 2-enamine to cernophila l-enolate is a challenging substrate because of its apparent steric availability, we were confident that tolterodine could be afforded in optically pure form through a two-step sequence that involved a high-yielding alkylation, followed by an amine-mediated -hetero-arylation. Given the success of our two-step technique, we relocated our next focus to en
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the inclusion of guns in organic molecules. We have often found that, in addition to enolization, reductive elimination can be facilitated by the incorporation of a gun. For example, the catalytic -elimination of alcohol 4. 23 from the Boscheriopsis pulmonium salt can be initiated by the addition of a gun, which generates a -carbonyl on the imine. From the RNA olfide structure, the organocatalytic -boat-launch sequence can be implemented. The Boscheri protocol was also applied to the case of 3-methylquinuclidine, in which a -boat was also incorporated.  The results clearly demonstrate that the iminium ion can acquire a -role in the presence of a competent hydrogen-bonding catalyst.  It appears that H-D-Pro is central to a number of differentially substituted organobles. It is noteworthy that the role of oxygen as an oxygen of the primary amine may be

An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the inclusion of trans in a reaction in which the cis-product is desired. Given that titration of the Lewis acids occurs on a peptide, we wondered if peptide-ligated transition metals could provide a handle for site-selective cross-couplings. As a prelude to these efforts, we pursued enantioselective cross-coupling as a means of exploring a possible avenue for site-selective catalysis. We hypothesized that if a prochiral center were present in the right peptide, the chirality of the ligand could be probed by the copy-rightful control of the chirality. Using Dmaa, N-methylimidazole, and a variety of chiral ligands, we were able to confirm the presence of a heteroatom among the side-chain amides.  Our initial entry into this new cross-coupling methodology was initiated with an examination of the intramolecular
====================
An underexplored direction in organocatalysis is the interplay between competing functional groups within the same compound. Indeed, it was found that primary alkyl cesium oxalates were suitable coupling partners, allowing the installation of medicinally important heterocyclic motifs. Last, control experiments have revealed that the combination of light, photoredox catalyst 1, and a commercially available iridium photoredox catalyst is essential for product formation.  The value of our aliphatic sp 3 C-H alkylation is further demonstrated by its applicability to other carbonyl classes, including a-methyl-and a-benzyl-substituted alkylomes. As shown in, a diverse range of a-methyl-and a-benzyl-substituted alkyl automata can be successfully employed to construct quaternary and trialkant bicyclic arenes. Importantly, this protocol is tolerant of significant steric variation on the aryl ring axis, although yields
